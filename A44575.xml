            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Scope of this Treatiſe is to demonſtrate Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be in no other Sence im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to Believers, than were their Sins to him; that is, as their Sin <hi>it ſelf,</hi> or in it's <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal nature,</hi> was not imputed to Chriſt, but only in the deſerved puniſhment thereof, ſo neither is Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs imputed to them otherwiſe than in it's bleſſed fruits and ſaving effects: So that Sinners being juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Chriſt's Obedience, or <hi>made righteous</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth it) is no more than their being diſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged and acquitted from Condemnation for the merit of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>The <hi>occaſion</hi> of my Undertaking this Service, was, the peruſing ſome late Books, concerning whoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
<pb facs="tcp:95157:3"/>though I muſt bear them record, that they have a <hi>zeal of God,</hi> yet I cannot ſay, as gladly I would, that it is <hi>according to knowledg.</hi> The Doctrine main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this Treatiſe is by one of the ſaid Authors Mr. <hi>Rolls</hi> accuſed as <hi>damnable doctrine,</hi> as a <hi>limb of Popery,</hi> yea <hi>the very Rats-bane of Popery,</hi> and the maintenance of it an <hi>expreſs contradiction of the Church of England in the great point of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> By which words, and many others to the ſame purpoſe, he hath done more credit to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and more wrong and diſhonour to our own Church, than I believe he did intend, or was aware of. Another of thoſe Authors Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> in his Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt Mr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> hath very much of the ſame uncharitable and unadviſed talk. And after the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal of theſe, Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi>'s Book, ſtyled <hi>the Intereſt of Reaſon in Religion</hi> came to my hands, wherein I perceived the like fervent and inordinate Zeal: Hereupon, as the Apoſtle ſaith of the good Zeal of his <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that <hi>it had provoked very many,</hi> the Zeal of theſe Brethren for the upholding and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating Error hath in a different Sence provoked me, <hi>viz.</hi> to offer an helping hand for the defence of the truth, nor hath ought elſe induced me hereunto; as having not the leaſt Pique at any of thoſe Authors <hi>perſons,</hi> in regard of their diſſent from my ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or on any other account, they being all perfectly unknown to me, nor the leaſt touch of envy at their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity, nor was I excited to this undertaking by any other.</p>
            <p>If any ſhall object againſt my thus <hi>voluntarily</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in this Conteſt, as <hi>Eliab</hi> did againſt his brother
<pb facs="tcp:95157:3"/>
               <hi>David</hi>'s forwardneſs to another kind of Combate, ſaying, <hi>it is the pride and naughtineſs of thy heart,</hi> I think it enough to reply as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Is there not a Cauſe?</hi> Seeing ſo many at this time employ to the utmoſt their Pens and Tongues to decry and defame the great Truths here contended for, and to defend and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the erroneous Principles here oppoſed.</p>
            <p>As for my <hi>manner</hi> of writing, I was ſolicitous only to ſpeak intelligibly to the capacity of ordinary Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, not affecting curioſity of the Stile: And, I hope, it will appear that I have endeavoured to <hi>right</hi> the Truths of the Goſpel without <hi>wronging</hi> any of my diſſenting Brethren, by miſrepreſenting their words or ſence or uncomely reflections upon any of them: I think it expedient likewiſe to declare, that in this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy concerning <hi>imputed Righteouſneſs,</hi> I do not ſtep forth as a <hi>ſecond</hi> to any, who have of late appeared for the Cauſe I maintain, either particularly Mr. <hi>R. Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Sherlock,</hi> Mr. <hi>Joſeph Truman,</hi> Mr. <hi>Edward Fowler,</hi> or any other. My only aim was, according to my ſlender Talent, to ſerve and bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the truth, without deſign to pleaſe or gratify any perſon.</p>
            <p>If after this Profeſſion of an honeſt meaning and ſincere deſire to <hi>do good,</hi> it ſhall prove my Lot to <hi>hear ill</hi> in any kind, to be accuſed as a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicator, one who would build again what by his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription to the Articles and Homilies of the Church of <hi>England</hi> he hath deſtroyed, to be reproached as a <hi>Socinian,</hi> or to ſuffer by any other name of intended Ignominy, I ſhall not thereupon be ſo ſurprized, as if ſome ſtrange thing had happened to me, nor ſhall I in
<pb facs="tcp:95157:4"/>the leaſt (I hope through God's grace) be diſcouraged by ſuch uſage, nor yet exaſperated, but ſhall ſay in the words of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy, Truly this is a grief and I muſt bear it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, I think it not amiſs to add this Information, that the following Treatiſe is only <hi>one</hi> Part of what I deſigned to publiſh concerning <hi>imputed Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and that I have almoſt perfected a ſecond part concerning Forgiveneſs of Sin, as that very Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which is ſaid in Scripture to be imputed by God to believing Sinners, for the ſake of Chriſt's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; and withal concerning Faith, as the thing it ſelf, which is moſt expreſly and very frequently ſaid in Scripture to be imputed for Righteouſneſs; with the reſolution of many material Queſtions pertaining thereunto. I deſired to have had both theſe parts pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed together, but <hi>this</hi> having been a great while in the Preſs, it was thought more adviſable, that it ſhould not ſtay for the other, but come out by it ſelf.</p>
            <p>To conclude, Let us be <hi>zealouſly affected alwaies, Gal. 4.18.</hi> but with the great St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Limitation <hi>in a good thing,</hi> and according to the <hi>weight</hi> of every ſuch matter, let the height of our Zeal be; and above <hi>1 Pet. 4.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt is imputed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, is an aſſertion no where in <hi>terms</hi> to be
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95157:10"/>found in Scripture. And whereas by the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of one, or that one Righteouſneſs mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. is unqueſtionably meant the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt, expreſſed by name in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verſe: Yet this Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is not there, or in any other place of Scripture (for ought I know) expreſly ſaid to be imputed to us: and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the Scriptures are ſo ſilent therein, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but wonder, that any one ſhould affirm, that the ſound of the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is in the Scriptures as ſhril, or loud as was that of the Trumpet at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> as if the ſound thereof had gone forth ten times out of the mouth of the Apoſtle in that one Chapter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the truth is, that although there be frequent men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that Chapter of the words [Righteouſneſs and Imputed] nevertheleſs as to the <hi>Imputation</hi> of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Righteouſneſs there is <hi>Altum ſilentium,</hi> a deep ſilence, it being neither in that, nor in any other Chapter of the Bible expreſly aſſerted, that Chriſts Righteouſneſs is imputed to us.</p>
               <p>I will conclude this ſhort Chapter with the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage of <hi>Pareus de juſtitia Chriſti Act. &amp; Paſs. Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam legi, humanam ſanctitatem Chriſti nobis impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatam eſſe juſtitiam noſtram, vel ejus partem. Si quis legit, quaeſo mihi oſtendat, ut &amp; ego legam, &amp; credam.</hi> In this ſort muſt I needs ſay of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, whether Active, or Paſſive, or both, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſtinction, that I never found it expreſly ſaid to be imputed to us, or to be ours by imputation or any part of our righteouſneſs. If any man hath any where in the Bible read ſuch ſayings, I beſeech him to direct me to the Repoſitories (Chapter and Verſe) where they are to be found, that having read them, I may at once believe both my own eyes and his.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Have all our Proteſtant Preachers and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters erred from the truth of Scripture, who have ſpoken of Chriſts Righteouſneſs under the name, or notion of a Righteouſneſs impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or have aſſerted the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs to us. <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, two reaſons of which anſwer are rendred.</p>
               <p>Q. 2. <hi>FOraſmuch as it hath been very ordinary with our Proteſtant Divines both in their Sermons and Writings (both in polemical and poſitive Divinity) to ſay, That Chriſts Righteouſneſs is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, and imputed to us for righteouſneſs, have all of them erred from the truth in ſo ſaying?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, God forbid: for although none of them have preciſely kept to the form of wholſom words, but ſwerved or varied rather from the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Scripture in that ſaying, nevertheleſs there is no neceſſity to conclude them all to be under error upon that account: for 1. A man may poſſibly, yea, we do very ordinarily ſpeak the truth of Scripture, although not in the words, or terms of Scripture. An aſſertion may be a Scriptural truth, though it be not formed, or aſſerted in Scripture-words, and phraſe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> In what ſenſe is it true, or falſe, to ſay, That Chriſts Righteouſneſs is imputed to us? In anſwer hereunto a twofold acceptation of the word [Righteouſneſs] is ſpecified, reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to which different acceptation of the word, it is determined in what ſenſe the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs to us, is to be aſſerted, and in what ſenſe it is to be renounced, with certain Reaſons of the abrenunciation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>Q. 3. <hi>WHat are thoſe divers acceptations of the word [Righteouſneſs] with reſpect whereunto the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs to us may be aſserted as a truth, or is to be rejected as an Errour?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The word [Righteouſneſs] is taken in a double ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> properly, or figuratively: 1. It is taken in Scripture ſometimes, yea very often, impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, or figuratively, not for the thing it ſelf, but for the iſſue, or benefit thereof. This kind of Trope is uſual in Scripture and in common ſpeech, it being ordinary with us to put the name of a thing in the propriety of it inſtead of its return in the bleſſed iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, fruits, or products thereof. In this ſenſe the word is taken <hi>Job</hi> 33.26. where <hi>Elihu</hi> ſays, That <hi>God will render to a man his righteouſneſs (i.e.)</hi> not the thing it ſelf, but the fruit and comfort of it. In this ſenſe thoſe, who fear God, are ſaid to <hi>eat the labour of their hands (i.e.)</hi> that emolument, which with their hands they did labour for, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 28.2. In the like ſenſe he who planted a Vineyard, is ſaid
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95157:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>to eat, or not to eat of it <hi>(i.e.)</hi> of the fruit of it. <hi>Deut.</hi> 20.6. Thus <hi>work</hi> is put for the <hi>reward</hi> of it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13. <hi>Job</hi> 34.11. <hi>The work of a man will he render unto him.</hi> Thus <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.8. <hi>Whatſoever good thing any man doth, the ſame ſhall he receive of the Lord (i.e.)</hi> not the ſelf ſame thing, that is done, but the ſame in the fruit and reward of it. In the like ſenſe are thoſe words of St. <hi>John</hi> to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, wherein he admoniſhes the Elect Lady, and her Children to beware, That <hi>they loſe not the things which they had wrought (i.e.)</hi> the <hi>reward</hi> of the things wrought by them. Now in this ſenſe it is true to ſay, and a truth worthy of all acceptation, That Chriſts Righteouſneſs is imputed to us, that is, in the ſaving effects of it, or bleſſings procured by it. In this ſenſe to ſay, That Chriſts Righteouſneſs is imputed to us, is the ſelf ſame thing as to ſay, That the fruit and benefit procured by his Righteouſneſs is confer'd upon us. And this, I doubt not, is the meaning of the Apoſtle in thoſe his ſaying, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18, 19. That by Chriſts Righteouſneſs the free gift (of pardon, or juſtification) comes to us, and That by his obedience we (the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the many there mentioned) are made righteous <hi>(i.e.)</hi> we for the ſake of his righteouſneſs, or obedience, are conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted righteous <hi>(i.e.)</hi> pardoned, or juſtified. And be it obſerved, That as <hi>[Righteouſneſs]</hi> ſo <hi>ſin</hi> alſo in the ſame figurative ſenſe is ſaid to be imputed to a ſinner <hi>(i.e.)</hi> in the deſerved fruits and effects of it: When the deſerved puniſhment thereof is, or is not inflicted upon a ſinner, then is his ſin ſaid to be imputed, or not imputed to him. In this ſenſe thoſe words of <hi>Shimei</hi> ſupplicating his Soveraign for pardon, are to be underſtood, he ſaying, <hi>Let not my Lord impute iniquity unto me,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.19. Where by iniquity he doth not mean the thing it ſelf in a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95157:12"/>proper ſenſe, <hi>Ipſam culpam,</hi> the ſinful action, or the act of ſinning, but the deſerved fruit and puniſhment of it: In this ſenſe the word ſin, or iniquity, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry oftentimes taken in Scripture, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.13. and 19.15. <hi>Luke</hi> 7.18.</p>
               <p>And as touching the word [impute] when apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to what is in it ſelf good, or deſirable, be it obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, That it is the manner of Scripture ſometimes to expreſs the collation of a benefit upon us, or deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation thereof unto us by the word [impute] whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the benefit it ſelf accrues to us by the way of debt, or free donation, as appears <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. <hi>To him, that worketh, the reward is reckoned,</hi> or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted (for ſo the word is rendred three times in the ſame Chapter, v. 22, 23, 24.) <hi>not of grace, but of debt (i.e.)</hi> on ſuch a one it is confer'd not of grace, but of debt, and ſo to be reputed. In this ſenſe to ſay Chriſts Righteouſneſs is imputed to us, is all one as to ſay, Chriſts Righteouſneſs is in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fruit and benefit thereof confer'd upon us; and he, who ſays ſo, ſpeaks the very truth of Scripture. Having declared in what ſenſe the Imputation of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt may and ought to be aſſerted and maintained, I ſhall in the next place ſpecifie the ſenſe, wherein it is to be rejected, in order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto let it be obſerved, that</p>
               <p n="2">2. The word <hi>[Righteouſneſs]</hi> is ſometimes taken properly and formally for the very thing it ſelf in its eſſential nature, in which ſenſe, as it is very oftentimes taken, when applyed to the righteouſneſs of man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.2, 12, 28. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.35. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.13, 18, 20. ſo likewiſe to the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. where the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is expreſly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. And be it obſerved, That as Righteouſneſs in the former ſenſe may not unfitly (as I think) be ſtyled a Paſſive, and in the latter an Active Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95157:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſo the ſaid two different ſenſes of the word [Righteouſneſs] do differ as <hi>Officium &amp; Beneficium,</hi> the one being the receiving of ſome good,<note place="margin">They dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as work, and wages, as Duty and Mercy.</note> or benefit confer'd on us, the other the doing of ſome good, or duty performed by us. The phraſe [receiving righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs] ſee in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.5. <hi>He ſhall receive the bleſſing from the Lord, and Righteouſneſs from the God of his Salvation:</hi> Righteouſneſs in that place being the ſelf ſame thing with Gods bleſſing, his ſaving bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. The phraſe <hi>[doing righteouſneſs]</hi> ſee in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.7. <hi>He, that doth righteouſneſs, is righteous.</hi> As this is ſtiled a <hi>ſowing of righteouſneſs, Prov.</hi> 11.28. ſo that may very fitly and ſuitably to the language of Scripture both of the Old and New Teſtament be ſtyled <hi>Reaping Righteouſneſs, Hoſ.</hi> 10.12. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.7, 8, 9. Now in this proper, formal ſenſe of the word [Righteouſneſs] the Imputation of Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to us is a doctrine, however owned by too too many, yet by very many others of our own and forraign Proteſtant Churches juſtly diſowned as that, which is no where to be found in Scripture, whether in the words, or meaning of any Text in Scripture: for to aſſert, that Chriſts Righteouſneſs is in this ſenſe imputed to us, is to aſſert, That God doth account or reckon, that the Righteouſneſs which Chriſt wrought, we wrought in and by him, or that we are reputed by God to have fulfilled the Law, and ſatisfied Divine Juſtice in and by Chriſt, that what Chriſt did in his own natural Perſon, God doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, we did in and by him: for, to have any thing imputed to a man in the propriety, formality, or eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential nature of the thing, is to be reputed the doer of what is ſo imputed to him, theſe being terms e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent and explicatory one of another; and as thus explicated do the Brethren, whom I do take upon me in this point to oppoſe, openly own the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95157:13"/>ſaid doctrine touching the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs to us; it being their errour to think; that Chriſts Righteouſneſs cannot be accepted by God in our behoof, or prove ſavingly beneficial to us, unleſs it be imputed to us in their ſaid ſenſe; or to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine (as they do) a neceſſity, that what is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, or for the juſtification of a ſinner, ſhould be reputed to be done by him, who is juſtified; for it ſufficeth to imputation in this caſe, if that which is done, be accepted of God in the behalf of ſinners, or inſtead of that, which a juſtified perſon ſhould in his own perſon have performed. Nor is there any cauſe, or colour for them to ſuſpect, that the denial of the ſaid Imputation in their ſaid ſenſe doth infer, or include a denyal of Chriſts ſatisfaction, whether in the thing it ſelf, or in the bleſſed effects of it. I am at once both ſorry, and I wonder to read ſuch paſſages as theſe in ſome learned Authors, they ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this purpoſe, <hi>viz. That human reaſon, or mans underſtanding cannot comprehend, how Chriſts ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction can be of ſaving benefit to us, unleſs it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us in its formal and eſſential nature:</hi> The contrary whereunto is as obvious to be conceived by any unprejudicate perſon, as obvious almoſt can be. For my own part I do humbly conceive it to be a great and dangerous miſtake to think, that Chriſt ſatisfied Divine Juſtice for believing ſinners, that they might be reputed by God to have ſatisfied in and by him as their ſurety; the truth of Scripture (to my underſtanding) being this, <hi>viz.</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt did in human nature, and his own perſon as Mediatour, or in the perſon of a Mediatour betwixt God and Man ſatisfie Divine Juſtice, not that we might be reputed to have ſatisfied in and by him, or that his very ſatisfaction ſhould be imputed to us, but that no ſuch ſatisfaction ſhould be required of us; and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95157:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>that his fulfilling of the law of Mediatorſhip was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God not as our fulfilling either of that law (for the law of Mediatorſhip belonged not to us, it being peculiar to Chriſt himſelf) or of any other law whatſoever; but it was reckoned, reputed, or accepted by God as a ſatisfaction for our not fulfilling the law of God impoſed upon mankind: I mean, the law in the rigour of it, or as a covenant of works, and that ſuch an exact fulfilling of the law ſhould not be exacted of us as the covenanted condition of our ſalvation, but that faith and ſincere obedience to the Goſpel of Chriſt ſhould be ſo required. And I am glad to perceive, that in aſſerting the end of Chriſts ſatisfaction for mankind, I have the concurrence of the Authour of the Book lately publiſhed, ſtyled <hi>(The intereſt of Reaſon in Religion—)</hi> he ſaying <hi>pag.</hi> 548. <hi>It was in conſequence of Chriſts ſuſception to be our Sponſor</hi> (or Mediator, ſay I, the word Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor and Mediator being promiſcuouſly uſed by the Apoſtle, as appears by comparing <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. with chap. 8.6. and this latter word being of more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uſe with the Apoſtle, than the former, that being only once in its uſage applyed to Chriſt in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture) <hi>and with reſpect to the obedience of his life and ſacrifice of his death, as the procuring and deſerving cauſe, that God entred into a covenant with mankind, promiſing to pardon their ſins, receive them into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and crown them with life upon ſuch terms and conditions as the Father and Son thought fit to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe.</hi> In theſe words the word [Mankind] is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, the Authour ſaying expreſly, <hi>That for Chriſts ſake</hi> [for the obedience of his life and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of his death as the deſerving cauſe thereof] <hi>God entred into a Covenant</hi> [not only with a few, with the Elect only, but] <hi>with Mankind, promiſing</hi> — And I am the more glad to perceive, that I
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95157:14"/>have the concurrence of the ſaid Authour in aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Covenant of Grace to be procured for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, becauſe I ſhall have occaſion by and by to mention ſome things, wherein I am neceſſitated (much againſt my will) to diſſent from him, and certain others of my Brethren. And I ſhall take a fit occaſion to do it in anſwer to an Argument for the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs (in the ſenſe diſowned by my ſelf with many others) taken from thoſe words of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. from which words I have ſeen in a certain learned Author the Argument thus formed, as ſhall be expreſſed in the beginning of the next Chapter.</p>

               <p>'An Objection from <hi>2 Cor. 5.21.</hi> anſwered and alſo retorted. The blaſphemy of Mr. <hi>William Eyre</hi> in his Aſſize-Sermon preached at <hi>Sarum, 1652.</hi> reproved.</p>
               <p>QUomodo, <hi>in what ſort, or manner Chriſt was made ſin for us, in the ſame manner was he made Righteouſneſs to us. But he was made ſin for us only by Imputation.</hi> Ergo—</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Argument is not at all to the purpoſe in hand, or the matter here in controverſie, which is not, Whether Chriſts Righteouſneſs be imputed to us, or whether our ſins were imputed to him; for although it be not expreſly, and in terms aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in any place of the Bible, either that our ſins were imputed to Chriſt, or that his Righteouſneſs is imputed to us, nevertheleſs it is readily and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95157:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>granted, That both of them may truly be aſſerted in a certain ſenſe to be imputed, the only Queſtion being this, <hi>viz.</hi> In what ſenſe were our ſins imputed to Chriſt, and in what ſenſe is Chriſts Righteouſneſs imputed to us, whether as Sin and Righteouſneſs are taken properly, and formally, or elſe figuratively, and in the effects thereof; whether <hi>Formaliter,</hi> or <hi>Effective,</hi> as are the School termes: And that either the one, or the other were in their formal, and eſſential nature imputed (our Sins to Chriſt, or his Righteouſneſs to us) or otherwiſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him, or us, than in the fruits and effects thereof, that Scripture in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. doth not prove. Yea, that Scripture doth plainly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly prove and diſprove that ſenſe of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, which I have, and ſtill do both own and diſown <hi>(i.e.)</hi> own in the ſaid figurative and improper, but diſown in the formal and proper ſenſe of the word [Righteouſneſs.] And for the purpoſe in hand, an Argument from the ſaid Scripture may be thus formed:</p>
               <p>In what manner, or in what ſenſe of the word [Sin] Chriſt was made Sin for us, or our Sin was imputed to him, after ſuch a manner, or in the ſame ſenſe were we made the Righteouſneſs of God in him, or his Righteouſneſs was imputed to us;</p>
               <p>But he was not made Sin for us, nor was our Sin [formally taken, and in its eſſential nature] imputed to him, but only in its poenal fruits or puniſhment deſerved by it, <hi>Ergo</hi>—</p>
               <p>For proof of the <hi>Minor</hi> (for the <hi>Major</hi> will be yielded by all thoſe with whom I am now in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute) be it conſidered, That if our Sin it ſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly in its eſſential nature had been imputed to Chriſt, then had he been reputed by God to have
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95157:15"/>deſerved, or contracted the guilt of what he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which if ſo, he could not have ſatisfied for us, or his ſufferings be reckoned by God as ſatisfactory to Divine Juſtice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Apoſtle doth not ſay, that Chriſt was made a Sinner for us, nor do I know, how ſuch a ſaying can be vindicated from blaſpheming the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly One of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If Sin as properly taken was imputed to Chriſt, and he in that ſenſe of the word was made Sin for us, I ſee not, but that this blaſphemy will from thence follow, <hi>viz.</hi> That God reputed Chriſt to be a Sinner, or made him a Sinner for us. And this is that I find in a printed Sermon preached by Mr. <hi>William Eyre</hi> at the Aſſizes at <hi>Sarum,</hi>

                  <hi>Mark, how every thing is lively, and as full as can be imagined. Chriſt one, not only that had done no ſin, but that had not ſo much as known ſin, hath God made (not a ſinner, but) ſin it ſelf, as in another place (not accurſed, but) a curſe it ſelf; ſin in reſpect of the guilt; a curſe in reſpect of the puniſhment.</hi>

               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:95157:16"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Under Epiſcopal favour I humbly crave to reply by ſuggeſting my thoughts, as followeth:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. If this Authour muſt be ſuppoſed to inſinuate, that to <hi>know</hi> no ſin doth imply more than to <hi>do</hi> no ſin, I conceive it to be a miſtake; for although To <hi>know</hi> no ſin may be yielded to be a more ſignificant, or as is here ſaid, a lively expreſſion, yet I do not think that it is ſignificant of more than we are given to underſtand by that other expreſſion <hi>[He did no ſin]</hi> theſe two phraſes (the one of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the other of St. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2.22.) being of the ſelf ſame adequate importance. There be many phraſes, that are more emphatically ſignificant of the truth, or ſenſe intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſpeaker, that do not imply more truth, or more of ſenſe than other not ſo emphatical, but plain and downright expreſſions. Beſides, I leave it to the conſideration of the Learned, whether the expreſſion <hi>[He knew no ſin]</hi> be not an Hebraiſm, the Apoſtle therein ſpeaking after the manner of the Hebrews, in whoſe language the word <hi>[know]</hi> is uſed for To <hi>do,</hi> and this both as applyed to good and evil (as were eaſie to exemplifie) to know good and evil being no more in true ſenſe and conſtruction, than to do them.</item>
                  <item>2. As it is remarkable indeed, that the Apoſtle doth not ſay, that God made Chriſt a Sinner, ſo withal it is remarkable, that he doth not ſay, that God made him <hi>Sin it ſelf,</hi> but <hi>Sin.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. The phraſe [to be made Sin <hi>it ſelf</hi>] ſeems to ſound forth this ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> To be made Sin <hi>in it ſelf;</hi> which to ſay is to imply, that Chriſt was made a Sinner with a witneſs, a great Sinner; the word <hi>Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> being uſed by Latiniſts ſometimes for <hi>Sceleſtus.</hi> But I do not charge this ſenſe as intended by that Renowned Authour, however it be owned by Mr. <hi>William Eyre</hi> in his Sermon forecited, he quoting in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95157:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Margin of his Book certain of the Ancients (<hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> and <hi>Oecumenius</hi>) as aſſerting the ſame.</item>
                  <item>4. If the ſaid Authour muſt be ſuppoſed to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, That the phraſe <hi>[To be made ſin]</hi> is pregnant of more ſenſe, or doth imply more, than To be made a Sinner, I can ſay no leſs, than there is no ſuch impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but an implication of the contrary; For To be made ſin is a leſs thing, yea it is quite another kind of thing, than to be made a Sinner, for to be made a Sinner is to be made Culpable, <hi>Reus culpae,</hi> or guilty of fault, whereas to be made Sin doth imply no more than reſpectively to ſuffering to be dealt with as a Sinner, or to be made a Sin-offering, as was afore ſaid.</item>
                  <item>5. As guilt is diſtinguiſhed, or a diſtinct thing from puniſhment (theſe two things uſually diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by <hi>Reatus Culpae, &amp; Poenae,</hi> and ſometimes by <hi>Obligatio ad Culpam, &amp; Obligatio ad Poenam,</hi> as hath been already ſaid) Chriſt cannot be truly ſaid to have been made Sin in reſpect of the guilt, this being in effect to ſay, That he was made Culpable, or a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and did thereupon deſerve to ſuffer.</item>
                  <item>6. As [to know no Sin, and to do no Sin] are phraſes of the ſelf ſame adequate ſenſe and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſo alſo are the phraſes [To be made a curſe, and to be made accurſed] the former, though more emphatically ſignificant of the Speakers intended ſenſe, yet not importing more ſenſe as intended to be ſpoken.</item>
                  <item>7. Chriſt was no otherwiſe made Sin, than he was made a curſe; for in this very reſpect he is in one Scripture ſaid by the Apoſtle to have been <hi>made Sin for us,</hi> in that (as the Apoſtle expreſſeth and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets himſelf in another Scripture) he was made <hi>A Curſe for us:</hi> for he was made a Sin-offering by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoing the curſed death of the Croſs, or as Saint
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95157:17"/>
                     <hi>Peter</hi> expreſſeth the matter, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>By bearing our ſins in his own body upon the Tree,</hi> as the Altar upon which he offered himſelf as a Sacrifice without any ſpot of Sin to God.</item>

               <p>An Anſwer to ſeveral unjuſtifiable paſſages in Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi>'s Book, ſtyled <hi>[The Intereſt of Reaſon in Religion.—].</hi> His falſe and manifold uncharitable inſinuations, anſwered. Wherein 'tis ſhewed what manner of guilt or obligation to puniſhment that was, which Chriſt took upon him. That Chriſt did not ſuffer, however by occaſion of that Law <hi>(Gen. 2.17.)</hi> as tranſgreſſed, yet not by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue thereof, as if that Law in, or by his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings had been executed.

That it is not againſt the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Holineſs of God (as Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends) to juſtifie a ſinner upon an obedience <hi>(Ex parte ſui, ſeu peccatoris)</hi> imperfect, with the reaſon of his miſtake.</p>
               <p>HAving thus replyed to the words of that Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Biſhop (under whoſe authority the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries do in this conteſt take ſhelter) I ſhall addreſs my ſelf to make anſwer to Mr. <hi>Robert Ferguſon,</hi> who being a zealous aſſerter of the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs in the ſenſe here diſclaimed
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95157:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>and oppugned by me, doth endeavour the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnation and defence thereof in the following paſſages of his fore-named Book <hi>[The Intereſt of Reaſon in Religion.]</hi>

                  </note>P. 409. <hi>I will not here diſcourſe how inconſiſtent it ſeems with the wiſdom and ſapience of God to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a perfect righteouſneſs, ſuch as that of his Son was, meerly to make way for his juſtifying us upon an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect righteouſneſs, ſuch as that of our obedience is.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> So far as appears to me by the reading of his Book, this Brother hath not the true notion [I do not ſay of juſtification in general, or of the word as indefinitely taken, but] of Goſpel-juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or the juſtification of a ſinner, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, nor can be otherwiſe than by a pardon, and this pardon is not <hi>ex nudâ Dei voluntate,</hi> meerly of divine will and pleaſure, but merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſatisfaction of Chriſt. Of this his miſtake of the quiddity, or true nature of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-juſtification, I may have occaſion to ſpeak, in reply to ſome other paſſages of his Book. In the mean time, I ſhall take it as a truth not to be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, That Goſpel-juſtification is forgiveneſs of ſin, this kind of juſtification being it alone that a ſinner is a ſubject capable of, and thereupon I do reply, That however the matter ſeems to this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, nevertheleſs in truth it is no way inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the wiſdom of God, for the ſake of his Sons moſt perfect righteouſneſs, to juſtifie or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſinners upon an imperfect righteouſneſs, ſuch as that of our obedience is, which if perfect, would have no need of pardon.</p>
               <p>P. 409. <hi>Nor ſhall I argue,</hi>

                  <hi>How that the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſts life, and ſacrifice of his death, muſt be imputed to us for juſtification, in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionableneſs to our ſins, having been imputed

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have already granted, that in what ſence or ſort our ſins may be ſaid to have been imputed to Chriſt, his righteouſneſs may be ſaid to be imputed to us, but withal declared, that neither of them can be truly ſo ſaid to be imputed in the proper ſence of the words (ſin and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs) which is the ſence of this Author and his Abettors, but in an improper ſence, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> in the fruit and effects both of the one and the other.</p>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>To attribute Chriſts ſufferings meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Gods dominion without any reſpect to ſin, is the groſſeſt of Socinianiſm, and repugnant to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in an hundred places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They, who deny the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſs unto us, in the ſence by this Author aſſerted, are far from attributing Chriſts ſufferings meerly unto Gods dominion, without any reſpect to ſin: For as they do unanimouſly preach and print, that Chriſts ſufferings had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to our ſins, ſo they do attribute his ſufferings not meerly to Gods dominion, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ſin, but to that voluntary compact, which was betwixt the Father and the Son, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould ſuffer for ſin and ſinners, and that thereby he merited our pardon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſequently I cannot forbear to ſay, That it doth very ill become this Author to inſinuate ſo foul a ſlander againſt his Brethren, as guilty of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinianiſm, groſs Socinianiſm, the groſſeſt Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm in this matter.</p>

                  </note> P. 410. <hi>To ſay, That our ſins were imputed to Chriſt in the effects of them, but not in the guilt, is to contradict all principles of reaſon.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95157:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>to the laſt upon the account of our ſins, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been brought under the firſt. Nor is it imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, how without ſubmitting to the guilt of our ſins he could have been puniſhed, ſhould it be granted that without reſpect to them he might have ſuffered: Though without any habitude to ſin his ſufferings might have been dolorous, yet they could never have been penal.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. To ſay, That our ſins were imputed to Chriſt in the effects of them, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved puniſhment thereof, but withal to deny, that our guilt of fault was imputed to Chriſt, is not to contradict all principles, nor any one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of reaſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor doth it at all contradict any of thoſe Scriptures alledged by this Author in the Margin of his Book, which Scriptures do only prove an imputation of our ſins to Chriſt, in the ſence I own and acknowledg, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> in Chriſt his undergoing ſuffering for them, but not in his taking our guilt upon him. And as Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> doth well maintain the imputation of our ſins to Chriſt in the former reſpect, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the effects of them, ſo I am perſwaded, that that moſt learned Doctor is a man of more reaſon and better principled, than to maintain the imputation of our guilt to Chriſt, as this Author would have it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I grant, That guilt and obnoxiouſneſs to puniſhment are equipollent phraſes; but I deny, that it will follow from thence, that becauſe Chriſt took upon him to ſuffer the puniſhment, which we for our ſins deſerved, he did therefore take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him our guilt. He did indeed take upon him a certain guilt, or obligation to ſuffering; <hi>(i. e.)</hi> a guilt, or obligation peculiar to himſelf, but not the ſame guilt that lay upon us, not our guilt, not
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95157:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>the ſame numerical guilt, (for Philoſophy tells us, that an accident being removed from the ſubject periſheth) nor the ſame ſpecifical guilt, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> of the ſame ſort, but a guilt ſpecifically different, not having the ſame, but a far different <hi>Subſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> ground, foundation, or efficient, from ours; ours being <hi>Violatae Legis,</hi> grounded or founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our tranſgreſſion of Gods Law, but his <hi>Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionis propriae,</hi> an obligation of contract or conſent, founded upon the agreement betwixt him and his Father in that behalf. Obligation to puniſhment we ſtile guilt, and our guilt was guilt of fault, and of ſuffering for our fault, from or by vertue of Gods Law threatning the ſame; but Chriſts guilt was only guilt of ſuffering for our fault, ariſing from, or by vertue of his voluntary undertaking and compliance with the will of his Father. Brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That Law of God, which did threaten man with ſuffering for ſin, did not oblige Chriſt to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for it, or us, nor did he die by vertue of that Law threatning man with death, upon ſuppoſition of his ſin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. nor was that Law fulfilled, or executed in his death, but by occaſion of that ſin-threatning Law tranſgreſſed by man, he did voluntarily oblige himſelf in the perſon of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to ſuffer, and to ſuffer death for us, or for our ſins, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the expiation of them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Chriſt may well be ſuppoſed to be liable to ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the account of our ſins, by vertue of the ſaid contract betwixt him and his Father, without having been brought under our perſonal ſpecifical guilt. And it is eaſily imaginable, that without ſubmitting to our perſonal guilt, he might ſuffer ſuch ſuffering as was equivalent to that puniſhment, which we by our ſins had deſerved. This is as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily imaginable, as to imagine, how St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95157:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>take upon himſelf to ſatisfie for the damage, which was done to <hi>Philemon,</hi> by the injury of his unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervant <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> and was willing to have the ſame imputed to him, (as the word ſignifies, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> 18.) and yet not ſubmit unto or take upon him <hi>Oneſimus</hi> his perſonal guilt of defrauding, or wrong-doing. And (to ſpeak the very truth) in ſuch a ſence as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was willing to take upon himſelf the wrong done to <hi>Philemon</hi> by <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> and to have it reckoned to him, ſaying, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, impute it unto me, (meaning thereby not <hi>Oneſimus</hi> his perſonal guilt, <hi>Reatum culpae,</hi> or his ſin it ſelf, but the effects of it, in the damage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſuſtained by his Maſter.) In the like ſence (I ſay) were our ſins reckoned or imputed to Chriſt, he taking upon him an obligation by his doings and ſufferings, to ſatisfie for the damage or wrong done to God, (as I may ſo ſay) I mean, to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the Honour and Authority of the Law and Law-giver, to demonſtrate the juſtice of God, his hatred of ſin.—And indeed herein, <hi>viz.</hi> in an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude for the attainment of theſe and the like ends of God our Maker, Ruler, Law-giver, Benefactor, better than the damnation of all mankind could have done, conſiſteth the meritoriouſneſs and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactorineſs of Chriſts doings and ſufferings; and this is the reaſon of our ſtyling them ſatisfactory or meritorious.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Though we deny, that Chriſt took upon him our guilt of ſin, yet it will not follow from thence, that we deny his ſufferings to have had any habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, or reſpect at all to ſin, as is here inſinuated by this Author; for had it not been for our ſin, he had never ſuffered.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Foraſmuch as Chriſts ſufferings had not the ſelf ſame individual or kind of habitude to ſin, as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95157:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>our ſufferings, in caſe we had ſuffered according to our deſert, would have had, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> foraſmuch as Chriſts ſufferings were not merited, or inflicted on him, by or upon account of any ſin of his own, therefore are his ſufferings to be accounted rather dolorous than penal, I mean, puniſhments in a ſtrict, and the moſt proper acceptation of the word; puniſhment being properly and ſtrictly <hi>Malum tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte,</hi> inflicted upon a guilty perſon <hi>propter malum turpe.</hi> Proper puniſhment I conceive to be the effect of proper guilt, which is <hi>Reatus Criminis</hi> [Guilt of fault] not meerly <hi>Contracius</hi> [of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract] as Chriſts was.</p>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95157:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>infer by proportion, that the righteouſneſs of Chriſts life and ſacrifice of his death (his doings and ſufferings formally and properly taken) are not imputed unto us, or otherwiſe imputed than meerly in the benefits of them.</p>

                  <hi>how that ſecluding not only the righteouſneſs of Chriſts life, but the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of his death, as the matter, and the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, as the formal cauſe of juſtification, it ſeems repugnant to the immutability and eſſential holineſs of God to juſtifie us upon an imperfect obedience, the Law which requireth a perfect obedience remaining ſtill in force, and denouncing wrath, in caſe of every failure.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> By theſe words it appears again, that this Author doth miſtake the true notion and right conception of Goſpel-juſtification, he ſuppoſing, that the righteouſneſs of Chriſts life and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his death is the matter, and that the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it is the formal cauſe thereof; whereas the unqueſtionable truth (to my ſimple underſtanding) is, that if we ſpeak of matter in a proper ſence, as here, <hi>viz.</hi> for a material cauſe, in way of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinction to a formal cauſe, neither the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſts life, nor ſatisfaction of his death, can fitly be ſaid to be the matter, or material cauſe of a ſinners juſtification; the ſatisfactorineſs both of his life and death (of his doings and ſufferings) being undoubtedly the external impulſive, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally efficient cauſe thereof; and how one and the ſame thing ſhould put on the habitude of two cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſo different in kind, as is the material and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient (that being internal, and <hi>pars conſtitutiva rei,</hi> and this wholly external) I do not underſtand, ſuch a conception being altogether contrary to the Logick, which hitherto I have been acquainted with.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:95157:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas this Author and others make the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſs, to be the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal cauſe of juſtification, I do clearly conceive them miſtaken, and that the <hi>formalis ratio,</hi> or formal cauſe of Goſpel-juſtification, is forgiveneſs of ſin, this being <hi>Res ipſa,</hi> the very thing it ſelf, wherein the juſtification of a ſinner doth conſiſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Had this Author rightly apprehended or minded, that a ſinners juſtification is, or doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in, the pardon of his ſin, he would ſcarce have queſtioned it as a thing in the leaſt wiſe repugnant to the immutability and eſſential holineſs of God, to juſtifie us upon an imperfect obedience: For what though it may be granted, that the Law, which requireth a perfect obedience, and denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth wrath in caſe of every failure, doth remain ſtill in force <hi>(i. e.)</hi> ſo far forth as to command the one, and to threaten the other, yet I preſume he will not, I am ſure he ought not to ſay, That that original Law (the Law of works, I preſume, he means) doth ſtill ſtand in its primitive force, as a Covenant of works, both promiſing life to ſinners upon perfect obedience, or conditionally upon their not being ſinners, and threatning death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably upon every failure. Doth this Author forget, That there is a Law of Grace, of oblivion, a <hi>Lex remedians,</hi> a Law of indempnity enacted by God through the blood of Chriſt, whereby the force of that Law ſo threatning, may as to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the threatning, be vacated by a gracious pardon, and certainly ſo ſhall be, upon a ſinners ſincere however imperfect obedience to the Goſpel of Chriſt?</p>
               <p n="4">4. This Author ſeems to think, that a ſinner is juſtified in reſpect of the <hi>precept,</hi> or preceptive part of the Law, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> as one who had in and by
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95157:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>Chriſt performed all manner of duty, whereas a ſinner is juſtified only in reſpect of the <hi>ſanction</hi> of the Law, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> as one, who notwithſtanding his failings, hath right to impunity, and to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge for Chriſts ſake by a pardon.</p>

The Scripture no where aſſerts ſuch a ſurrogation of Chriſt in our room, as that we can properly be ſaid to be redeemed by him as our ſubſtitute: For had he been in a ſtrict proper ſence our ſubſtitute, there is cauſe to aſſert, That we have in and by him redeemed our ſelves, yea that we rather have redeemed our ſelves than he us, or That we are our own Redeemers rather than Chriſt: For what is done by a proper ſubſtitute, is not in a Law-ſence ſo much his act who doth it, as ours, whom he as our ſurrogate and ſubſtitute doth perſonate or repreſent, let the repreſentation be <hi>Quocun<expan>

               <p n="2">2. Foraſmuch as this Author doth aſſert ſuch a ſurrogation of Chriſt in our room, as that we can properly be ſaid to be redeemed by him as our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, if he ſhall notwithſtanding that aſſertion deny, That we have in and by Chriſt redeemed our ſelves, or are in and by him our own Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, it behoves him to conſider, how he can avoid the juſt imputation of that thwacking contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which upon his ſwopping miſtake he inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates his adverſaries in this point to be guilty of. And it concerns him alſo to conſider, how his <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis</hi> can be maintained, without admitting that injuſtice (which he mentions) in the Rector, who notwithanding his allowance of the ſaid ſubſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doth deny inſtantly to confer upon us the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of Chriſts redemption and ſatisfaction, theſe being no other than what we our ſelves have in and by Chriſt made a full ſatisfaction for, and which upon that account we may fitly and properly be ſaid to have purchaſed for our ſelves.</p>

And this as we do, ſo we may very well and warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly maintain, notwithſtanding it be yielded (as the truth is) That Chriſt was ſubſtituted or given of God, to make ſatisfaction to the demands of the Law and not of the Goſpel, in the ſence here ſpecified by this Author.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi>'s miſtake in thinking, that a ſinner by his juſtification is freed from the guilt of puniſhment and fault too. That Chriſts righteouſneſs is not more, or otherwiſe imputed to us for, in, towards, or in order to our juſtification, than the remiſſion of our ſin. The nature of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification [forenſick] opened, both of juſtification indefinitely conſidered, as alſo of Goſpel-juſtification in ſpecial. The truth of the matter laid down in ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</p>

But foraſmuch as I judg'd it moſt conducive to the conviction of gain-ſayers, and to the edification of all, to ſhape my reply thereunto, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, period by period, I have therefore accordingly recited them, and ſuited my reply to every diſtinct period in thoſe pages. As for his enſuing arguings in the ſame Chapter to the cloſe thereof, I cannot in ſuch ſort recite them <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim,</hi> without the tranſcribing of ſeven or eight whole pages, from p. 413. to p. 421. nor will it be at all neceſſary ſo to do, it being fully ſatisfactory to demonſtrate, that his arguings do proceed upon his utter miſtake of the true nature of Goſpel-juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, or that peculiar kind of juſtification, whereof a ſinner is the ſubject, or ſubjective mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and for the manifeſtation thereof be it conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, That he premiſeth theſe two things, p. 413, 414.
<list>
                     <item>1. That to juſtifie is in its proper acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here a forenſick term, ſignifying to acquit and abſolve one that is accuſed.</item>
                     <item>2. That juſtification not only ſuppoſeth us to be indited, but withal imports an abſolution from the charge of that Law, of the breach whereof we are accuſed, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list> The Law of perfect obedience, which is not abrogated by the Law of faith, but doth remain in force, and we being all guilty of the violation of its terms, there lyes accordingly a charge againſt us, from which by juſtification we are, as he ſays, to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted.</p>
               <p>Now yielding to the former of the two premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which he proves by ſeveral Scriptures apt to the purpoſe, I reply to the latter, That there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a two-fold guilt, which the Law of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing violated, may be ſuppoſed to accuſe us of, or
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95157:24"/>charge us with (the ignorance or non-obſervance of which diſtinction, is the cauſe of great confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and miſunderſtanding in the doctrine of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation) <hi>viz.</hi> guilt of fault, and guilt of puniſhment, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> actual obligation to puniſhment, it is the great miſtake of this Author (as of many other of our Brethren) to think, that by juſtification we are freed or acquitted from both the ſaid kinds of guilt, or (as ſome do imagine) that by pardon of ſin we are freed from the latter kind of guilt, and by juſtification with the perfect righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to us, from the former. Whereas the truth is, That the righteouſneſs of Chriſt is no more, nor otherwiſe imputed to or for the juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a ſinner, than it is to or for the non-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the pardon of his ſins, and that there is no poſſibility for a ſinner by any plea what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, to be juſtified or acquitted from the former kind of guilt, I have already manifeſted, and ſhall farther manifeſt according to occaſion in the ſequel of this Treatiſe. In the mean time I will ſpeak ſomewhat more at large for the due underſtanding of the nature of juſtification, both as indefinitely conſidered, and ſpecially, as the ſubject thereof is a ſinner. And in order thereunto I will lay down the following Propoſitions.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Juſtification as indefinitely taken,<note place="margin">Propoſ. 1.</note> or as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from the conſideration of the ſpecial quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the perſon juſtified, is the abſolution of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſuppos'd to be accuſed from the guilt that he is charged with, and according to the quality of the perſon accuſed (guilty or not guilty) ſuch is the nature of his juſtification. If innocent, he is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <hi>à reatu culpae,</hi> from guilt of fault, or from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving deſerved any puniſhment, through any fault he is charged with. In this ſence the word is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95157:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>in many Scriptures, as in <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.1. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 5.23. And ſo I conceive the word is taken in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. Only it is to be underſtood, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> there ſpeaks of that kind of juſtification, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſtyled <hi>Juſtificatio cauſae,</hi> not <hi>perſonae,</hi> his meaning being, not that he was conſcious to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of no ſin at all, but not of inſincerity or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs in his ſtewardſhip or Miniſterial office, in which reſpect he was able to juſtifie himſelf, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that was a thing comparatively not ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, foraſmuch as he muſt ſtand to the final ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of God the Judge of all.</item>
                  <item>2. If the perſon accuſed be guilty or culpable,<note place="margin">Propoſ. 2.</note> his juſtification is of another kind or nature, the only juſtification which ſuch a perſon is capable of, being from another charge, <hi>viz.</hi> from the guilt of puniſhment, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> from his being actually bound over to ſuffer, and from the ſuffering it ſelf of that puniſhment, which for his delinquency he deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. With the former kind of juſtification, no fleſh living (all being ſinful fleſh) can poſſibly be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. God himſelf (with Reverence to the divine Majeſty be it ſpoken) hath no kind of power to juſtifie any wicked perſon, no moral power, (for it is a ſinful thing ſo to juſtifie the wicked, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.15.) nor phyſical power, (for the thing is ſimply impoſſible, and doth imply a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.) But with the other kind of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, any fleſh living (though never ſo ſinful) may and ſhall through Goſpel-faith and obedience, or an obediential faith, be juſtified.</item>
                  <item>3. As juſtification and forgiveneſs of ſin are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly and vulgarly taken,<note place="margin">Propoſ. 3.</note> or according to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſage of ſpeech, ſo they are contrary the one to the other, as is light and darkneſs: For to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a perſon in common uſe of the word, is to free
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95157:25"/>or abſolve him from guilt of fault, to acquit him as innocent from the fact or fault of which he is wrongfully accuſed. And this kind of juſtification is by a two-fold plea, either the denial of the fact, (hereby <hi>David</hi> juſtified himſelf from the imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.9, 10.) or by denying the fault, pleading the fact to be no fault, or breach of any Law, whether of God, (by which plea <hi>Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> juſtified himſelf againſt the accuſation of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed enemies, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.22.) or man, or both, (by which plea St. <hi>Paul</hi> juſtified himſelf againſt the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations of his Countrey-men the <hi>Jews, Act.</hi> 24.14.) maintaining his innocency not only in reſpect of the Law of God, but alſo of <hi>Caeſar, Act.</hi> 25.8. there being no Acts at that time made by any of the <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars</hi> againſt Chriſtian Religion, nor till the fifth year of the reign of <hi>Claudius,</hi> as Hiſtory doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. So that if a perſon be juſtified in this vulgar ſence of the word, he is not ſo much as in a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral capacity of being pardoned, nor if pardoned, of being ſo juſtified as aforeſaid;<note place="margin">I never heard of the ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of one perſon in the room of another, to have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in criminal caſes, whatever allowance there hath been in pecuniary mulcts, or matters.</note> pardon of ſin and juſtification in the ſaid vulgar ſence, being of ſo contrary a nature, that if the one be affirmed of any perſon, the other muſt needs be denied. And in this ſence of the word (juſtifie) this Author ſpeaks truth in ſaying, <hi>p.</hi> 416. <hi>That as to juſtifie and to pardon are not only wholly diſtinct in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Idea's, but always ſeparated in the caſes of ſuch as are arraigned at humane tribunals, (unleſs it be where the ſubſtitution of one perſon in the room of another is allowed) and even then, though they accompany one another, yet they are both diſtinct acts, and we have diſtinct notions of them: For neither can an accuſed innocent by being acquitted be ſaid to be pardoned, nor a condemned criminal by having the execution of his ſentence remitted, be ſaid to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:95157:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <item>4. However in common uſage, juſtification and remiſſion of ſin are not only divers, but alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe things, nevertheleſs if we ſpeak of that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar kind of juſtification frequently mentioned in the Scripture, whereof a ſinner is the ſubject, and of that kind of pardon, that is peculiar to ſinners ſo oft there mentioned, (a pardon conveyed by Law, and purchaſed by the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, not that kind of pardon, which is <hi>ex nudâ voluntate</hi>) if, I ſay, we do ſpeak of this kind of juſtification and pardon, then I do affirm it as an undoubted truth, That juſtification and pardon of ſin are words equivalent, importing one and the ſelf ſame thing, without any real or ſubſtantial difference, for proof whereof, two or three Texts of Scriptures may ſuffice (among ſeveral others) to be produced. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.38, 39. <hi>Be it known to you, that through this man is preach'd unto you the forgiveneſs of ſins, and by him all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which you could not be juſtified by the Law of Moſes, (i. e.)</hi> for which the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no expiatory ſacrifice in order to pardon. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24, 25. <hi>Being juſtified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt, whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſs for the remiſſion of ſins that are paſt, through the forbearance of God, to declare I ſay at this time his righteouſneſs, that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him who is of the faith of Jeſus, (i. e.)</hi> of the Chriſtian faith. See alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. where that which he calls bleſſedneſs, <hi>v.</hi> 9. and Gods juſtifying the ungodly, <hi>v.</hi> 5. he ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Gods forgiving their iniquities, and covering their ſins.

               <p>By the way take notice, That I have ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerning his affirming, that the introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Law of faith hath not abrogated the Law of perfect obedience, but this as well as that doth remain in force; nor do I think it neceſſary ſo to have done: For although ſome chooſe to ſay, that that Law of our Creation, or of God our Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, is abrogated or repealed, (there being no Law ſince the new modelling of the government of mankind, but the Law of Redemption, or of God our Redeemer, the moral part of the original Law being taken into it as the matter thereof) and others chooſe to aſſert only a diſpenſation or relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of that Law, nevertheleſs I do humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that (all things conſidered, yet not ſo need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful here to be mentioned, that are ſaid on both ſides) there is no real difference between them as to ſubſtance of truth, but only in modes and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeaking, and for that cauſe I can give liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to any one to ſpeak the truth with due caution, in what words he pleaſeth. Only I muſt ſay, That I dare not take liberty to my ſelf to ſay, That the Law of works doth now remain in force as well as the Law of faith, without a juſt explication, how far it doth and doth not remain now in force. I well remember, that two late worthy Authors do very differently expreſs themſelves, touching the immediate effect of the introduction of the Law of faith. The moſt learned Mr. <hi>George Lawſon</hi> chooſeth to ſay, That the original Law (of works) is by the Law of faith or indempnity abrogated and repealed; whereas Mr. <hi>Joſeph Truman</hi> will not
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95157:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>allow that ſaying, inſtead thereof aſſerting it to be only relaxed, or diſpenced with, and he gives rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for what he ſays. But becauſe his reaſons are not (I think) ſo convincing, as to be uncapable of a ſatisfactory reply, and foraſmuch as I do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the difference betwixt them (all things conſidered) to be rather verbal, than real, I can therefore leave every man to his own choice, in wording the matter as he pleaſeth. Only I ſhall ſay, That although I do not impute any error of judgement to Mr. <hi>F.</hi> in ſaying, <hi>[That the introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Law of faith, hath not abrogated the Law of perfect obedience, but this as well as that remaineth in force]</hi> nevertheleſs foraſmuch as ſuch ſayings do need explication, I wiſh for the truths ſake, that ſuch ſayings were not roundly and ſimply uttered, or without due caution and explication.</p>
               <p>The premiſſes conſidered, it is eaſie what judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to make of ſeveral paſſages in this Author, which I will now recite, and briefly animadvert upon.</p>

A ſinner not otherwiſe made juſt and righteous by his being juſtified, than by his being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned through Chriſt.

               <p>P. 415.<note place="margin">Mr. F.</note> 
                  <hi>AND indeed the</hi> Socinians <hi>expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this more conſonantly to their principles, than ſome others do: For having ſtated the whole of juſtification in the remiſſion of ſin, upon performance of the conditions of the Goſpel, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of this they accordingly plead for the utter ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation of the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. What the <hi>Socinians</hi> do hold concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the abrogation, or non-abrogation of the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Law, I concern not my ſelf to know. This only will I ſay, That by how much the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> are more obliged to this Author, for his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity towards them in this matter, by ſo much are thoſe his Brethren (the <hi>ſome</hi> intended by him) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a contrary ſcore bound to con him the leſs thanks.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As I ſaid before, ſo I ſay again, That thoſe Brethren who do hold, that the Law of works is abrogated, and thoſe who ſay, it is not abrogated
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95157:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>or repealed, but diſpenced with and relaxed, do both of them agree in this truth, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is a Law ſtill in force, that doth command perfect obedience, under the penalty of damnation, (the only difference between them, for ought I know, being in this, <hi>viz.</hi> By what Law it is now requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or by what name that Law is to be ſtyled, whether the Law of works, or the Law of grace, wherein ſay the former it is indeed required, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the penalty of damnation, but not perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and unavoidably <hi>ex parte Legis,</hi> as it was in the Law of works, but with a Proviſo, as to the execution thereof.) Now foraſmuch as our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren do univerſally accord as aforeſaid, I judge this Author to be unjuſt in determining, that the <hi>Socinians</hi> do expreſs themſelves more conſonantly to their principles, than ſome others do.</p>
               <p>The Author arguing for juſtification, its being a different thing from pardon of ſin, becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we cannot in any propriety of ſpeech, be ſaid to be juſtified from the accuſation of the Law, he ſaith in that caſe as followeth.</p>
               <p>P. 416. <hi>Pardoned indeed we may be,</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>but juſtified in a proper ſence we cannot. For to ſuppoſe God to pronounce a perſon juſt that is unjuſt, or to declare him righteous that is unrighteous, is to make him pronounce a ſentence that is unjuſt and falſe, and to act repugnantly to his own holy and righteous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> As to the juſtification of a ſinner from the accuſation of the Law, whether it is, or may be properly or no ſo called, I ſhall ſpeak my thoughts by and by, in my Anſwer to a Queſtion that ſhall be put expreſly for that purpoſe. Mean while it may be ſufficient to ſay, 1. That if by juſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt this Author doth mean a ſinner and no ſinner,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95157:28"/>(as for ought I know he doth, and agreeably to his principle, touching the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſs to us, in its eſſential na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he muſt mean) he doth utterly miſtake the nature of juſtification in thinking, That a ſinner through the imputation of Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is of unjuſt made juſt, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> of a ſinner made perfectly righteous, and freed from guilt of fault, the impoſſibility whereof I have already ſpoken of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſinner is no otherwiſe of unjuſt and unrighteous made juſt and righteous, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtified, than by being pardoned; and what kind of righteouſneſs that is, wherewith he is by his juſtification or pardon made juſt and righteous, I will at large declare in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to a Queſtion, which ſhall be the ſubject of another Chapter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Foraſmuch as it hath been already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that a ſinner cannot poſſibly be diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the Law, its accuſation of him as a ſinner, or its charging him with the guilt of ſin, this Author muſt needs err in thinking, that in any manner of ſence (proper or impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per) a ſinner can be ſaid to be juſtified from the ſame.</p>

               <p>THE difference betwixt remiſſion of ſin and Juſtification, he doth ſpecifie in the following words.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe words are true, if underſtood of Remiſſion, <hi>ex nudâ voluntate,</hi> and of the Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a perſon innocent. But if underſtood of Goſpel-Juſtification [the Juſtification of a ſinner] and of Goſpel-pardon, (which for kind is both a pardon derived to us by Law, and purchaſed for us by a ſatisfactory price) they are notoriouſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true: For as we are freely juſtified, ſo we are freely pardoned by divine grace, through the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption that is in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Eph.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. As it is beſt known to the Author himſelf, what kind of Remiſſion and Juſtification he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thoſe words, ſo it is too too ſuſpicious by his words immediately following, that he did mean Goſpel-Pardon and Goſpel-Juſtification, which words of his I ſhall recite, and leave it to the Judgment of the impartial Reader, what his meaning was.</p>

                  <hi>The word</hi> Juſtifie, <hi>neither in its Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, nor application and uſage, according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of men, and leaſt of all in the Scripture-uſurpation, is equipollent to pardon, nor coincident with</hi> to Forgive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. However it may be in ſome reſpects uſeful to know the Etymology and uſage of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſpeech, nevertheleſs this is not ſo much to be regarded in the ſtating or determining of any Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion pertaining to Divinity, the uſage of words in Scripture being as the Pole-Star, to direct the courſe of our conceptions (as I may ſo ſay) in ſuch matters: And for that cauſe I cannot but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend that paſſage of this Author, he ſaying, <hi>p.</hi> 155. <hi>That that which is chiefly to be attended unto in the ſencing of Scripture, is the uſe of words in ſacred Writers, God being many times pleaſed to reſtrain or enlarge the ſignification of words, as in his wiſdom he judgeth meet.</hi> And I do the rather mind the Author of this his ſaying, becauſe if we regard the Etymology of the word Juſtifie, it will (to ſpeak the leaſt) as much favour the Popiſh ſencing of the word, (th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. As for the uſage of words in common ſpeech, this is ſometimes contrary to their common uſage in Scripture, as I have already declared in the uſe of the word <hi>Juſtifie,</hi> this ſignifying in common uſage, to abſolve or acquit a perſon <hi>à reatu culpae, (i. e.)</hi> as innocent and not guilty. And becauſe this Author (as I gueſs by his name) is a <hi>Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> I ſhall therefore put him in mind, That whereas to be juſtified and to be pardoned are all one in the uſage of Scripture, they are contrary in the uſage of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to be juſtified there being not be pardoned, but to be hang'd, our <hi>Scotch</hi> Brethren uſing to ſay, That a man is juſtified, when he is hang'd or executed; as I learn from the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> in his Notes upon ſome place of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans.</hi>

                  <hi>SO that upon the whole, If we be not made Righteous with the perfect Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to us, but that God only for the ſake of Chriſt will diſpence with the rigour of the Law, and—I dare affirm, that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification as it is oppoſed to the accuſation of the Law, its charging us with guilt, and its paſſing ſentence of condemnation againſt us thereupon, doth not admit a proper ſence in the whole Scripture, but muſt every where be conſtrued Metaphorically; and that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of it is, not that we are properly and in a Law-ſence juſtified, but that ſuch benefits accrue to us by Remiſſion of ſin, as if we were ſo. According to the ſentiments of our Author, we are only pardoned, but by reaſon of ſome alluſion betwixt the advantages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounding to us by forgiveneſs, and the priviledges,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95157:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>immunities and benefits, which enſue upon a proper Juſtification, we are therefore Metaphorically ſaid to be juſtified. It were to bid defiance to the Scripture in an hundred places, to ſay that we are not at all ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, and yet in effect their principles imply no leſs: For by ſtating the whole of our aſſoilment, from the accuſation of the Law in remiſſion of ſin, they indeed ſay, that we are not juſtified, only we are improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid to be ſo.</hi>—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is the error of this Author, as of many others to ſay, that we are made Righteous With the perfect Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to us. And among others, I perceive Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> doth err in this particular, which becauſe he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to prove by certain Scriptures in his late Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, <hi>p.</hi> 102, 103. I will for the truths ſake re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply thereunto. 1. He alledgeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. By his obedience we are made Righteous, made ſo <hi>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> (ſays he) and <hi>accepted.</hi> To which I anſwer, 1. That Scripture proves not the Doctor's pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, nor is pertinent thereunto; for the Apoſtle doth not ſay as the Doctor would have him, <hi>With</hi> whoſe obedience, but <hi>By</hi> whoſe obedience we are made Righteous; now we may be truly ſaid to be made Righteous <hi>By</hi> it, though we neither are, nor can be truly ſaid to be made Righteous <hi>With</hi> it: For,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe two Monoſyllables (<hi>By</hi> and <hi>With</hi>) are very much different in ſignification, the former particle [By] implying the nature, energy, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of an efficient, and as here applied, morally efficient, or meritorious cauſe, the latter particle [With] pregnantly importing the nature, or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of a formal cauſe. Now foraſmuch as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor is a man of ſuch reading and learning, as that he cannot be ignorant of the true ſtate of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95157:31"/>about the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto us, (it being not at all touching the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious cauſe of our Juſtification, whether we are juſtified By Chriſts Righteouſneſs, but about the formal cauſe, whether we are juſtified With Chriſts Righteouſneſs imputed, as ſome ſay, or With the Imputation thereof, as ſay ſome others, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> with the very thing if ſelf imputed to us, or with the imputation thereof in its formal or eſſential nature.) I ſay, Foraſmuch as this Doctor cannot but know theſe things, it did ill become his learning and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, to hood-wink the eyes of the vulgar Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, from ſeeing the true ſtate of the Queſtion, and conſequently from perceiving, how nothing at all to the purpoſe in hand this Scripture is, that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is not the leaſt whiſper of the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt as Imputed to us, or of the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſts obedience to us, in that of <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. For though the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>By his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> yet he doth not ſay, By his obedience Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, or By the Imputation of his obedience we are made Righteous. No, as to the words (Imputed, and Imputation) there is <hi>Altum ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> not a word or ſyllable.</p>
               <p n="4">2. The Doctor adjoyns thereunto, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. ſaying, That this is that, which the Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be found in, in oppoſition to his own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. To which I anſwer, That the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs wherein St. <hi>Paul</hi> did there deſire to be found, was not the obedience or righteouſneſs of Chriſt, in oppoſition to his own evangelical obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, (as the Doctor here ſays, and too too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with him) but his own evangelical obedience, or the ſincere practice of Chriſtian Religion, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the bleſſed conſequents and benefits
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:95157:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>thereof, or promiſed through Chriſt thereunto, in oppoſition to a Judaical righteouſneſs (ſtyled his own, he being a perfect Jew by deſcent, an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew of the Hebrews) with all its carnal privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, of which that Nation did ſo much boaſt, which notwithſtanding being put in competition with thoſe of Chriſtianity, were in his eſteem no better than dung, than that we call Garbage, or Dogs-meat, as is the importance of the word there uſed by him, whereby to expreſs his contempt in the higheſt degree. That this is the true meaning of the Apoſtle, I may have occaſion farther to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate. In the mean while I ſhall take into conſideration, what the Doctor affirms concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our own obedience or righteouſneſs, and Chriſts, he ſaying in theſe words, <hi>This diſtinction the Apoſtle doth evidently deliver and confirm, ſo as nothing can be more clearly revealed,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>To this be it anſwered; Of a truth I perceive, how like to the black or yellow Jaundiſe that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of the intellect is, which we call Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice or Prepoſſeſſion, in that it makes us as confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as confidence it ſelf, that we do ſee, and ſee evidently, and as clearly as can be, ſuch entities, and adjuncts of entities, as have no viſible exiſtence to the eye or underſtanding of any impartial man: For 1. there is <hi>ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. All I ſee in theſe words is, A diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Grace of God, together with the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or works of faith, or faith wrought in us by free grace, and certain other works, in oppoſition unto, and contradiſtinction from the ſaid Grace
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95157:32"/>and Faith, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> works wrought by their own natural ſtrength, without the infuſion of ſpecial graces, antecedent to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> their embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the faith of Chriſt, and conſequently ſuch works, as do make for boaſting.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hereupon I cannot but wonder, in what term or terms of the ſaid Scripture, the moſt ſharp-ſighted or Eagle-ey'd Divine, can perceive the obedience of Chriſt to be ſo evidently there deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, as that nothing can be more clearly reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Surely the Doctor will not ſay, That by Grace or by Faith viſibly there mentioned, is meant the obedience of Chriſt; for Grace and Faith and Chriſts obedience, are without all controverſie ſeveral things, whether phyſically, metaphyſically, or theologically conſidered; ſo that one member of the Doctor's diſtinction is evidently wanting in that Scripture; although I readily grant, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as every act doth preſuppoſe an object, faith muſt be underſtood there not as excluding, but as including the perſon and obedience of Chriſt, I will not ſay (though ſome peradventure will) as its adequate, but as its partial, however prime, object.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Were the obedience of Chriſt there expreſly mentioned, nevertheleſs it is to be denied, That this obedience of Chriſt is there oppoſed to our obedience, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> to our <hi>evangelical</hi> obedience, or to the faithful works thereof (as the Docto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> would have it) but to another kind of works, which do make for boaſting, as was afore-ſaid. And this I may perhaps endeavour to make apparent in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Treatiſe, and there manifeſt, how the Doctor doth miſtake the true ſence of the word <hi>(ſaved)</hi> in that Scripture, which although he interprets for juſtified, (and ſo indeed in ſome Scriptures it is to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95157:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>be interpreted, and it is an important truth, that Goſpel-Juſtification is the ſelf-ſame thing with ſalvation from the guilt of ſin) neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by <hi>[ſaved]</hi> in that place is meant ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, quickned, regenerated, ſaved, from the power of ſin. This right interpretation of the word <hi>[ſaved]</hi> doth utterly make void what the Doctor ſays in the following lines, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to confirm the diſtinction betwixt Chriſts obedience and our evangelical obedience, to be there as evidently delivered, ſo as that nothing can be more clearly revealed.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now return to the fore-cited words of Mr. <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> to which I anſwer, 1. I do deny, That to aſſert that the preciſe nature of Goſpel-Juſtification doth conſiſt in Remiſſion of ſin, doth bid defiance to the Scripture in an hundred places, or that that Principle doth imply, That we are not at all juſtified. And if I ſhould ſay, in compliance with the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage here of this Author, I do defie Mr. <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> to prove what he hath charged, as the effect of the ſaid Principle, I think, I ſhould be blameleſs: But I ſhall chooſe to forbear that word, it being my deſire and deſign to reply with words of alike meekneſs as wiſdom, whatever provocation there be to the contrary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I deny, That to ſtate the whole of our aſſoilment, from the accuſation of the Law in Remiſſion, is indeed to ſay, That we are not juſtified.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I deny, That to ſay, That a ſinner is in an improper ſence ſaid to be juſtified, is indeed to ſay, That we are not juſtified. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us bone!</hi> To ſay, That God is ſaid in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95157:33"/>proper ſence to render to a man his work, (work being put for wages, or the reward of his work) is this indeed to ſay, That God will not render to a man his work, or that his work ſhall not be rewarded of God?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe it is ſuch an abhorring to this Author to conceive, or ſpeak of a ſinner his being in an improper ſence ſaid to be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I will therefore (the matter being now ripe for ſuch a purpoſe) put it to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, as followeth in the next Chapter.</p>

               <p>Q. <hi>IS a ſinner ſaid in a proper or an improper ſence to be juſtified? Anſw.</hi> 1. I think this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be too too near of affinity with thoſe, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> in one place calls <hi>unprofitable and vain, Tit.</hi> 3.9. and the native product whereof (as he ſays in another, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.4.) are <hi>envy, ſtrife, rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:95157:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>evil ſurmiſings;</hi> and for that cauſe I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, that it ought not much to be diſputed; it being no whit material, whether a ſinner be ſaid in a proper or improper ſence to be juſtified; for (to uſe the Apoſtles expreſſion, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.18.) <hi>not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding every way,</hi> whether properly or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly a ſinner is juſtified truly; <hi>I therein do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, yea, and will rejoyce,</hi> yea and cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than rejoyce, and rejoyce to eternity. What need there in effect to be more ſaid to the comfort of a ſinner, than what our Saviour ſaid to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <hi>Son, be of good chear, thy ſins are forgiven thee, Mat.</hi> 9.2. That Leper was as happy in his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his ſins forgiven him, as was the penitent Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican in departing from the Temple to his houſe juſtified, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nevertheleſs foraſmuch as an improper kind of Juſtification doth, I perceive, ſo ſtick in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack of this Brother, as that he cannot digeſt it, I ſhall for this once endeavour to prove, That a pardoned ſinner may in a proper ſence be ſaid to be juſtified, or That a ſinner juſtified with a pardon, is properly ſaid to be juſtified. I am not ignorant, that ſome very learned men do diſtinguiſh of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in a Law-ſence, into that which is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and that which is improperly ſo denominated, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning the Juſtification of an innocent perſon to the former ſence of the word, and of a ſinner to the latter. But for my own part I am of opinion, That both the innocent and the ſinner may be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid to be juſtified, <hi>ſenſu forenſi proprie dicto,</hi> in a proper Law-ſence: For what though the Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of theſe two ſort of ſubjects, be of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent kind, yet both of them for their kind may be proper, they being conſidered reſpectively to their different habitudes, which I will endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, as followeth.</p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:95157:34"/>
               <p>The Charge from which an innocent perſon is juſtified, is guilt of <hi>fault,</hi> the Charge from which a ſinner is juſtified, is guilt of, or obligation to <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</hi> Now why may not he, that is juſtified from this latter charge, be as properly in his kind ſaid to be juſtified, as the former in his kind? I know nothing ſhould hinder, except it be ſaid and prov'd, that the Law hinders; but that the Law doth not hinder, I prove, Becauſe as the caſe ſtands with ſinners to God-wards, there is a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Law for the Juſtification of the one, as well as of the other; there being a Goſpel-Law for the Juſtification of ſinners, which like the Law of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> is not to alter, but to ſtand even to the worlds end. And foraſmuch as a ſinners Juſtification is by the Law of faith or the Goſpel, and in that reſpect is a legal kind of Juſtification, I do therefore judge, That this Author is clearly miſtaken in his affirming, that a ſinner pardoned, cannot be properly and in a Law-ſence ſaid to be juſtified; for is not he, who is juſtified by, from, and through Law (the ſtanding-Law of faith) juſtified in a Law-ſence?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Foraſmuch as there is a two-fold Juſtice, (1. Of <hi>obedience,</hi> when all is done and left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, which the Law did either command or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, and conſequently no deſert of penalty incur'd. 2. Of <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> when, the breach of the Law ſuppoſed, there is due ſatisfaction made to the Law, in conſideration of that breach) why may not he, who can plead the Juſtice of ſatisfaction, be properly ſaid to be juſtified, as he in his kind, who hath performed the Juſtice of obedience, the former being <hi>Rectus in Curiâ,</hi> as well as the latter? Where (by the way) if I have offended this Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by minding him of that [to us Engliſhmen
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95157:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>moſt uncouth] ſaying of his Countreymen, That a man when he is hang'd, is juſtified, or juſtified by being hang'd, I will make him ſatisfaction, by juſtifying the ſaying to be rational, and this upon the account of the foreſaid diſtinction of a two-fold Juſtice (of obedience and of ſatisfaction) upon which latter account, the Malefactor executed may be reputed juſt, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> with that kind of Juſtice called the Juſtice of ſatisfaction, foraſmuch as he, who hath ſuffered the penalty of the Law, hath thereby ſatisfied the Law. To this ſence is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the uſe of the word (Juſtifie) in the form of Commiſſion iſſued from our King to his Judges, (as I have ſomewhere read) <hi>Praecipimus tibi, quod tu juſticies,</hi> We command thee, that thou ſhalt juſtifie <hi>(i. e.)</hi> ſee, that the Law be every way ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. But becauſe I foreſee an Objection, I will therefore anſwer it. Obj. <hi>The alone ſatisfaction, which a ſinner can plead for his pardon, is not by his own either doings or ſufferings, but only by Chriſts, and therefore a pardoned ſinner is not properly juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or pardon of ſin cannot in a proper ſence be ſtyled Juſtification? Anſw.</hi> If for this reaſon a ſinners pardon cannot in a proper ſence be ſtyled Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then his pardon cannot in a proper ſence be called pardon: For according to the pretence or principle of this Author, pardon of ſin in a proper ſence is <hi>ex nudâ voluntate,</hi> upon meer good will and pleaſure, and without ſatisfaction. And if ſo, yet I hope, that he will not deny Goſpel-pardon of ſin, becauſe it is not pardon in a proper ſence. Nor can I conceive any juſt reaſon, why any man ſhould be in leſs love and liking with Goſpel-Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, becauſe it is not properly ſuch, than with Goſpel-pardon upon the ſame account. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I ſhall ſay, Let this Author reject, and be
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:95157:35"/>diſpleaſed with both, or elſe with neither of them, upon the poor pretence of the impropriety of the word or words; which if he be with either of them upon any ſuch ſcore, all that I will ſay is, that I cannot help it. Only foraſmuch as various ways of expreſſing the ſame thing, do much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the better inſtruction, and more effectual conviction of an adverſary, I will expreſs my mind in another manner of diſtinguiſhing, as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               <p>As there are two integral parts of Gods Law, <hi>viz.</hi> The Precept and the Sanction, (the one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting <hi>Debitum Officii,</hi> the other <hi>Debitum Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicii</hi>) ſo there is <hi>Senſu forenſi,</hi> a two-fold Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
<list>
                     <item>1. With reſpect to the <hi>precept</hi> of the Law, when a perſon accuſed of fault can ſay to his Accuſers, as our Saviour did, <hi>Which of you convinceth me of ſin?</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. With reſpect to the <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty</hi> of the Law, when a perſon guilty can plead ſatisfaction made for his treſpaſs or treſpaſſes againſt it, and that the Law therefore is diſabled from condemning him.</item>
                  </list> Now becauſe I do conceive, (as will be ſaid more fitly in another Chapter) that ſatisfaction is a proper righteouſneſs of its kind, reſpectively to the ſanction of the Law, even as innocency is a proper righteouſneſs of its kind, with reſpect to the precepts thereof, I do not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perceive, but that a ſinner may as well and properly be ſaid to be juſtified, with reſpect to the ſanction of the Law, upon ſatisfaction made, as an innocent perſon, with reſpect to the precept of the Law, upon perfect obedience thereunto.</p>
               <p>But I do ſo little regard, what this or any other Authors do fancy, concerning the impropriety of our being juſtified By, or (to ſpeak more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) With a pardon, that I can give them leave to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95157:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>think and ſpeak therein as they pleaſe, being fully aſſured, That I am as properly ſaid to be juſtified, as pardoned; yea though neither par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned nor juſtified properly, yet foraſmuch as I am aſſured, that being pardoned and juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (properly or improperly) I am certainly pardoned and certainly juſtified, and ſhall be glorified, I am well contented with it, and am abundantly thankful to God and Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus for it.</p>
               <p>Thus have I dared to oppoſe, what this Author (as he ſays) hath dared to affirm, <hi>viz. That if a ſinners Juſtification be the ſame thing with the Remiſſion of his ſins, then doth that his Juſtification not admit a proper ſence in the whole Scripture, and that to ſay ſo, is in effect to ſay, we are not at all juſtified, and ſo to bid defiance to the Scripture in a hundred places.</hi> And I do leave it to the judgement of every learned and impartial Reader, what ſentence to pronounce both upon the one and the other, this his Affirmation, and my Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. I ſhall in the next place addreſs my ſelf to the anſwering of another Queſtion, as followeth.</p>

               <p>Q. <hi>FOR what reaſon or reaſons, can pardon of ſin be ſtyled Juſtification, and Juſtification par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don? Anſw.</hi> I ſay concerning this Queſtion, as of the former, That it is not very material: For if I know, that Gods pardoning mercy, as in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it goes under divers other names, (Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Salvation, Reconciliation, Righteouſneſs—) goes alſo under the name <hi>Juſtification,</hi> I may very well reſt aſſured, that there is a reaſon for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the only wiſe God will not give a name to any thing, for which there is no reaſon. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Author either is ignorant of the reaſons uſually rendred for it, or elſe doth diſſemble his knowledge thereof, I will therefore for his ſake, make anſwer to the ſaid Queſtion, and I deſire, that my Anſwers may be lookt upon as a <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondium,</hi> or meaſure running over, given into his boſom. My Anſwers are,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. One Reaſon, why Gods ſaving mercy to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners is called by different names, is taken from the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95157:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>divers miſchievous effects, or conſequences of ſin. Becauſe ſin doth make the ſinner obnoxious unto, or binds him over to puniſhment, therefore is Gods ſaving mercy in the blood of Chriſt towards ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſtyled Remiſſion, this being Gods looſing the bond, or diſcharging of the ſinner from the ſaid obligation.</item>
                  <item>2. If Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi>'s opinion be right, <hi>viz.</hi> That if an offendor be pardoned without any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends and ſatisfaction, he is not at all juſtified, and conſequently where a fault is of that nature, as that no ſufficient ſatisfaction or amends can be made, there can be no juſtification of a perſon ſo offending, then this reaſon will well warrant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin to be ſtyled Juſtification, <hi>viz.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our pardon is a peculiar kind of pardon, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> not <hi>Pura puta &amp; omni modo gratuita,</hi> meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in all reſpects free, but ſome way merited, <hi>viz.</hi> By the ſatisfaction of Chriſt our Mediator, whereupon God is juſt, and doth exerciſe juſtice in the pardoning of ſinners, and conſequently may be ſaid to juſtifie thoſe, whom he doth upon ſuch conſideration remit.</item>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95157:37"/>who being perfectly innocent is impleaded.

But as I have endeavoured to cure him of that his miſ-conception, ſo I doubt not, but that this reaſon will be of a perfect good reliſh, to others of another and more ſound palate.</item>
                  <item>4. Another Reaſon (as ſome think) is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a ſinner is pardoned by courſe of Law, his pardon is derived, or accrews to him, not as that of a Malefactor ſometimes doth, by the meer will and prerogative of his Soveraign Prince, but by vertue of the Law of the Goſpel, enacted as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument for the conveyance thereof.</item>
               </list>
               <p>As for the Reaſons of Remiſſion of ſin, its being ſtyled Juſtification, and Juſtification its being ſtyled Remiſſion of ſin, I think they may be fitly to the purpoſe in hand thus expreſſed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Goſpel-Juſtification is ſtyled Remiſſion of ſin, in reſpect of the quality of the perſon, who is the <hi>Materia, circa quam,</hi> the ſubject, about which that ſaving grace or mercy is converſant, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or recipient ſubject thereof being not an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, but a perſon in himſelf obnoxious, <hi>viz.</hi> a ſinner: For Goſpel-Juſtification though <hi>Juſta</hi>(juſt) yet it is not <hi>Juſtification Juſti,</hi> but <hi>Injuſti, (i. e.)</hi> it is the diſcharge of a perſon, who in himſelf is unjuſt, from that obligation to puniſhment, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he is charged by the Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Remiſſion of ſin is in the N. T. frequently ſtyled Juſtification, in regard of the manner of its conveyance, which is not as many others, if not moſt pardons from man are, upon meer good will

But before I proceed to reply to any other paſſage in his Book, which concerns the matter in hand, I will anſwer a Queſtion, that will come in fitly to be propoſed, by occaſion of what hath been ſaid upon this laſt, namely, That the juſtification of a ſinner is By a Law.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> How is the juſtification of a ſinner to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated, whether Evangelical or Legal? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Rather Evangelical, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon aſsigned. The Arguments of thoſe on the contrary ſide both anſwered and retorted, who acknowledge, that the juſtification of a ſinner is Evangelical <hi>ex parte principii,</hi> but would not have it abſolutely to be ſo ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but rather a Legal juſtification. The reaſon why this Queſtion is debated and anſwered.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>HOW is the Juſtification of a ſinner to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated, whether Evangelical, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Legal? Anſw.</hi> I propoſe this Queſtion, not for the ſatisfaction of Mr. <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> but for the ſake of ſome other Brethren, who may need a due information therein: And my anſwer is, That
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95157:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>foraſmuch as that Law, by which a ſinner is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, is The Law of Faith, of Grace, or of the Goſpel, it is therefore to be denominated not a Legal, but an Evangelical Juſtification. Herein [by not Legal] I muſt not in reaſon be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to mean Not in any ſence ſo, or by no Law at all, but not by the Law of works, or as the word Legal is oppoſed to, or contradiſtinguiſhed from the word Evangelical. And there cannot be (as I think) a more convincing Argument to prove, That Evangelical in the caſe, or queſtion in hand, is the fitteſt name, than by alledging that,<note place="margin">The Law of works is not the Law, By which, but a Law, From which, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> by an appeal from which to the Law of grace, a ſinner is and is to be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> which will be granted by all, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Law, by which a ſinner is juſtified, is an Evangelical Law, the Law of the Goſpel: For foraſmuch as the Law, by which a man was and is to be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is two-fold,
<list>
                     <item>1. The Law of God Creator, commonly ſtyled <hi>Lex originalis,</hi> or Law of works;</item>
                     <item>2. The Law of God Redeemer, called <hi>Lex reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> or the Law of grace or faith;</item>
                  </list> and foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the former Law was enacted, as the Rule of juſtifying an innocent perſon, and the latter of a ſinner, how can we better expreſs the difference betwixt the juſtification of an innocent and a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, than by ſtyling the former a Legal, and the latter an Evangelical Juſtification? The peculiar ſpecies of the Law, by which a perſon is juſtified, is that which doth ſpecificate the juſtification it ſelf, and is therefore moſt apt and fit to give it its pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar denomination.</p>
               <p>I deſire, That the anſwer here given may the rather be duely weighed and obſerv'd, becauſe it may ſerve to rectifie the miſtake of a certain learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Author, (perhaps alſo of ſome other Brethren) who albeit he doth allow a ſinners juſtification to be Evangelical, <hi>ex parte principii,</hi> (Evangelical
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95157:39"/>Grace in Chriſt, being the fountain of it) and ſo to be called, with a reſpect thereunto, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he will not allow it roundly and abſolutely to be denominated Evangelical, but rather Legal, for theſe two reaſons: Becauſe it is Legal, <hi>ex parte</hi> termini <hi>&amp;</hi> medii. 1. <hi>Ex parte</hi> termini, <hi>becauſe it is minated in the ſatisfaction, which is to be made or performed to the Law: He hath freed me from the Law of ſin and death.</hi>—</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, What he means here by the ſatisfaction to be made to the Law, (upon which the juſtification of a ſinner is by him ſaid to be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated) I do not know, nor will I take upon me ſo much as to gueſs, leſt I ſhould miſtake his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; only I will ſay as followeth, 1. That by <hi>the Law of the Spirit of life,</hi> (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2.) is meant the Evangelical Law, the Goſpel of Chriſt, or Law of Faith. 2. That Juſtification is one part at leaſt of that ſaving benefit, which the Apoſtle compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth under the expreſſion of his being by that Law, <hi>made free from the Law of ſin and death,</hi> it being as well the guilt of ſin, as the power of ſin, which by that Law he was made free from.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſequently I ſay, That that Scripture proves not the Author's purpoſe, but the direct contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That becauſe it is by the Law of the Goſpel, that we are made free, or juſtified from the guilt of our ſins, therefore our Juſtification is to be called Evangelical, and not Legal.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Reſpeciu</hi> medii, <hi>in reſpec<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>i of the</hi> means (ſays he) <hi>which is the Legal Righteouſneſs of Chrifr, by, or through faith imputed to us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, 1. As in ſome reſpect the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt may be ſtyled <hi>Juſtitia Legalis,</hi> (the Law of his Mediatorſhip requiring it, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rule thereof) ſo in another reſpect it may be
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95157:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>fitly ſaid to be <hi>Juſtitia pro-Legalis,</hi> (it being to us inſtead, or ſtanding us inſtead of a perfect legal Righteouſneſs) ſo alſo in another reſpect it may very fitly be ſtyled (and ſo I find it ſtyled by ſome Authors) our evangelical righteouſneſs; and an evangelical righteouſneſs it may, I ſay, be very fitly ſtyled,
<list>
                     <item>1. Becauſe the Goſpel is it, and it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone (not the light of nature) by which it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and made known to the world.</item>
                     <item>2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was of Gods grace to appoint it.</item>
                     <item>3. To accept it alſo, and this for gracious or Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ends, <hi>viz.</hi> the pardon or juſtification of ſinners. And for this reaſon I may well conclude, That the juſtification of ſinners is to be denominated not a legal (as the Author contends for) but an evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Juſtification.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As for his ſaying, <hi>That this legal Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt is imputed to us by, or through faith;</hi> I anſwer, 1. It is not at all imputed to us in the ſence of this Author, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> properly, and in its eſſential nature, but only in the ſaving effects thereof, as I have already (I hope) convincingly demonſtrated.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nevertheleſs I grant, that [in ſubordination to the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt] faith is a <hi>Medium,</hi> or means of a ſinners juſtification, though it is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of <hi>Medium,</hi> than is Chriſts Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to which it is ſubordinate in the juſtifying of a ſinner; Chriſts Righteouſneſs being ſuch a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> as hath the nature or efficiency of a merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cauſe, but our faith having only the nature of a condition ſimply ſo called. I have thought meet to intimate this for theſe two reaſons, 1. To prevent the miſ-underſtanding of what I ſaid in the foregoing Chapter, wherein was ſaid, that Goſpel-pardon was <hi>ex Chriſti ſatisfactione,</hi> and <hi>ex pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toris
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95157:40"/>fide,</hi> which muſt not be ſo underſtood, as if the word <hi>ex</hi> did imply the ſelf ſame importance in both places: For the truth is, that as the particle <hi>ex</hi> is of different importance (it importing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one kind of cauſe, and ſometimes another, and ſometimes no cauſe at all, but an antecedent condition, and the ſame I may ſay of the particles in Engliſh, Greek and Hebrew correſponding to the Latine particle <hi>ex</hi>) ſo in the former applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the particle, it doth imply efficiency, or an efficient meritorious cauſe, but in the latter only an antecedent, or a condition, <hi>ſine quâ non.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To prevent the miſ-conſtruction of the word [faith] in many places of Scripture, where, by faith many do underſtand only its object (Chriſt, or his Righteouſneſs) whereas, as faith and Chriſts Righteouſneſs are two things of diſtinct conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo by faith in ſuch ſayings as theſe (<hi>We are juſtified By faith,</hi> and <hi>ſaved By faith—</hi>) we are to underſtand not only the object thereof as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed (Chriſt, or his Righteouſneſs) but alſo the act believing, or the thing it ſelf <hi>faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, I anſwer, That foraſmuch as God is graciouſly pleaſed in his Goſpel, to appoint and to declare his acceptance of faith, as the condition of a ſinners juſtification, through, or for the ſake of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, therefore I anſwer as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, That a ſinners juſtification is to be denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted rather Evangelical, than Legal.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now return to Mr. <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> and reply to certain other paſſages, which I find here and there diſperſed in his Book, as grounds for the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs to us, in the ſence by him contended for.</p>

                  <hi>by tranſgreſſing the Law of Creation, Gods Rectorſhip over him, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by his wiſdom, holineſs, veracity, and the eternal rectitude and righteouſneſs of his nature, would not allow, that he ſhould be received into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, but in ſuch a way, and by ſuch means, as may ſecure the ends of government, manifeſt the diſpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency that is in God to ſin, evidence his truth and immutability, in proceeding according to the penal Law, which in purſuance of his own Attributes, and mans rational nature and relation, he had at firſt enacted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I aſſent to the whole of what is here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, except this, That God did for the ends ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, proceed according to the penal Law, which at firſt was enacted, in which ſaying, there is a complication of miſtakes involved; for 1. That Law was only diſpenced, and not executed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon Chriſt, nor upon mankind; not upon Chriſt; for Chriſt was not at all threatned in that Law, neither did he die the death by vertue of that Law, however by occaſion of it, as hath been
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95157:41"/>already ſaid. Nor was that Law executed upon all mankind, ſuppoſing, (and taking it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) that by the death there threatned, is meant eternal as well as temporal death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A miſtake of the nature of that obligation, which a divine commination doth induce, ſeems to be implyed in the ſaid words of this Author; for <hi>Comminatio eſt obligatio Legem violantis ad poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam ferendam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of God do induce only an obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors to ſuffer the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but not any neceſſary obligation upon God to inflict it.</note> 
                  <hi>non Legem ferentis ad inferendam;</hi> that commination did ſignifie what man was bound to ſuffer, not what God was bound to do: Upon diſobedience man was bound to ſuffer, but God was not thereupon bound to inflict puniſhment; otherwiſe ſupream Law-givers could have no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to pardon; and therefore there is no neceſſity, that the puniſhment threatned ſhould be executed, and it is an error to aſſert, or imagine any ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity: The only inevitable effect of that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was, That upon mans ſin puniſhment ſhould be his due, and ſo it was; man being bound to puniſhment <hi>Ipſofacto,</hi> upon his offence commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And herein is the difference betwixt a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and a Denunciation of puniſhment, this being an act of judgment or ſentence, or elſe a prediction of a decree to puniſh, whereupon the puniſhment denounced is always inflicted.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There ſeems alſo to be this miſtake (a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake of very evil conſequence) implyed in the clauſe fore-cited, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt ſuffered the <hi>Idem,</hi> not the <hi>Tantundem,</hi> the ſame ſuffering, to which that Commination did oblige, and that a ſinners liberation from the puniſhment, to which he was obliged, was by the way of ſtrict payment, not ſatisfaction, or compenſation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There ſeems alſo to be this miſtake implyed in the ſaid clauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That the ends of Gods ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95157:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>rule and government, could not be ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a Compenſation, or without ſtrict ſolution, or payment of that very debt of puniſhment, which was by the ſin of man contracted. And if I were ſure, that this Author would own this opinion, (for God forbid, that I ſhould cauſleſly faſten any thing upon him, or any of my Brethren) <hi>viz.</hi> That the ſufferings of Chriſt were <hi>Ipſa debiti ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi> and not <hi>Pro debito ſatisfactio,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chriſts ſufferings were not the very payment of our debt in kind, but a valuable ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice for our not payment of it, or for Gods not exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof.</note> I would more at large ſuggeſt ſomewhat of my own, and endeavour to improve what hath been (ſo far as my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge reacheth) ſaid by others againſt it. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs becauſe there are of my Brethren, who do maintain, that Chriſt ſuffered the very <hi>Idem,</hi> which was in a ſinners obligation, and not the <hi>Tantun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem,</hi> at leaſt that it is not much material, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſay the one, or the other, I will for their ſatisfaction, do theſe two things;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. I will briefly ſet down the ſubſtance of what is commonly and truly (as I believe) ſaid by the moſt learned judicious Divines, whoſe writings I am acquainted with, in this matter.</item>
                  <item>2. I will ſuggeſt two or three things, which I conceive to be the native conſequences of Chriſt his ſuffering, the <hi>Idem</hi> of our obligation, and not the <hi>Tantundem.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>For the firſt be it conſidered,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the perſon who made the payment, was not the ſame who was in the obligation, but another: For it was not Chriſt, who was in the obligation, but the ſinner, the Law threatning not him in perſon, or him in our perſon, but the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Briefly, that Law obliged none to die, but the ſinner, nor any other to die for or inſtead of the ſinner.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſufferings of Chriſt were not altogether
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95157:42"/>of the ſame kind. There was that excluſion of ſinners from the favour of God, threatned in the curſe, and which ſhall one day be executed upon ſome ſinners, which was not ſuffered, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone by Chriſt: For as the Apoſtle ſays, upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of a perfect ſimilitude betwixt our great High-Prieſt, and thoſe after the order of <hi>Aaron, (Then muſt Chriſt often have ſuffered ſince the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world,</hi> Heb. 9.26.) Even ſo, upon ſuppoſition,<note place="margin">The ground of Chriſts obligatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and our obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly different: for ours was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the guilt of ſin commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but Chriſts was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon his own voluntary ſponſion, whence it is, that ours is juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatio Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis,</hi> but His only <hi>Cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</hi>
                  </note> that whatſoever ſuffering was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the ſinner, was inflicted upon Chriſt, I may ſay, Then Jeſus Chriſt ſhould have often ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſince the foundation of the world; yea to the end of the world, yea world without end, even to all eternity. His ſufferings (foraſmuch as he was both God and man in one perſon) how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were equivalent to whatſoever was threatned by the original Law to ſinners, yet they were not the ſame.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ground and reaſon of Chriſts and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners obligation to ſuffer, was not of the ſame kind, or denomination, his being <hi>Obligatio fidejuſſoria,</hi> or <hi>Contractus,</hi> but ours <hi>Criminis,</hi> or <hi>ex delicto,</hi> as hath been already ſaid. As ſinners were obliged to ſuffer by one Law, ſo Chriſts obligation did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from another, and that Law peculiar to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for the evil conſequences of aſſerting, That Chriſt ſuffered the <hi>Idem,</hi> the ſame thing which was in a ſinners obligation to ſuffer, be it conſidered, that thence it will follow, That a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhould <hi>Ipſo facto</hi> have an immediate preſent right, to be diſcharged from his obligation to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer (according to that celebrated ſaying of the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilians, Solutione ejus quod debetur, tollitur obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio</hi>) which to ſay, is a branch of down-right <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomian</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:95157:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>doctrine, which maintains the Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Infidels, or of ſinners, in their damnable unbelief.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It follows, That a ſinners diſcharge from his obligation to ſuffer, is not truly, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot rationally be ſtyled Pardon of ſin, or that a ſinner (upon ſuch a ſuppoſition) cannot ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally be ſaid to be pardoned: For I look upon the ſayings of thoſe two learned men (<hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Wotton</hi>) as undoubted truths, <hi>viz. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi idem ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitur vel à debitore, vel ab alio debitoris nomine, nulla contingit remiſſio; nihil enim circa debitum agit Creditor, aut Rector.</hi> Grot. <hi>de ſatisf. p.</hi> 119. <hi>Where the ſame thing is paid either by the debtor himſelf, or by any other in his name, there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, or pardon of the debt.</hi> The Creditor, or Rector, doth in that caſe act nothing, he only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the debt. And ſays Mr. <hi>Wotton, De recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. Pecc. p.</hi> 157. <hi>Poena, ac venia diverſa ſunt, ita planè, ut qui poenas dederit, non ſit abſolutus, qui abſolutus eſt, ſupplicio affectus non fuit. Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and pardon are contrary</hi> (ſo the word <hi>Diverſae</hi> is here to be conſtrued) <hi>ſo as that he, who hath ſuffered the puniſhment for his ſin, is not pardoned, or abſolved, and he who is abſolved</hi> (i.e.) abſolved by a pardon, <hi>was not puniſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My reply to what this Author ſays in the next Page, ſhall be the ſubject of the following Chapter.</p>
               <p>Only leſt I ſhould ſeem willing (which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a thing far from me) to charge this Author, with the holding of any point of doctrine, which he doth diſ-own, I think it meet at the cloſe of this Chapter, to give the Reader to underſtand, that he doth elſe-where in effect ſay, That Chriſt did not ſuffer the <hi>Idem,</hi> but the <hi>Tantundem;</hi> for
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95157:43"/>he ſays expreſly, <hi>p.</hi> 557. <hi>That Chriſt ſubmitted to the demerit of our ſins, ſo as to undergo the penalty in the ſubſtance and kind of it (though not in the adjuncts, and conſequential accidents, which would have accompanied it upon ſuch weak, finite, depraved ſubjects as we are) that we ſhould have undergone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon all that I can peremptorily ſay is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That I am not able to reconcile this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor with himſelf in both his ſaid ſayings: For if Chriſt did undergo the penalty of the Law, which we ſhould have undergone only in the ſubſtance, and not in the circumſtances thereof, as here ſpecified, how was it true to ſay as he ſaid in Page 536. <hi>That in Chriſts ſuffering for our ſins, God did evidence his truth and immutability, in proceeding according to the Penal Law, which in purſuance of his own At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, and mans rational Nature and relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to God, he had at firſt enacted?</hi> For was not the circumſtances, adjuncts, or accidents of puniſhment, as well as the ſubſtance of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, threatned to man in that penal Law, and which man having ſin'd, ſhould according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have undergone? Now if Chriſt did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the penalty only in the ſubſtance, but not in the adjuncts threatned, how is this conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with his ſaying, <hi>That in the ſufferings of Chriſt, God did proceed according to the penal Law, which at firſt was enacted?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not reconcileable to, but flatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth to ſay, That Chriſt ſuffered that puniſhment in kind, which we ſhould have undergone: For I would demand of him, Was not eternal death comprized in the penalty
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95157:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>threatned in that Law at firſt enacted?</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="2">2. We deny not, but that Jeſus Chriſt may be truly ſaid to have ſuffered in our room or ſtead, (and for that cauſe to be ſtyled in the word of one of the Ancients our <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>That Chriſt may very well be ſaid to be made ſin for us, to bear our ſins, to die for our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences—although it cannot be truly ſaid, that he did bear our ſin it ſelf, or ſin in it ſelf, or otherwiſe than in the fruit and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it, the contrary whereunto is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by Mr. <hi>F.</hi> Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi>'s mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake in confounding an Antecedent impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive cauſe, with a meritorious cauſe, the difference whereof is aſſerted and exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.

That though our ſins did properly merit Chriſts ſuffering, nevertheleſs it will not follow from thence, that Chriſt himſelf did merit it, or took upon him the meriting thereof. That Chriſt may be ſaid in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper ſence to be puniſhed. The word <hi>[Demerit of puniſhmeit]</hi> ambiguous, a two-fold ſence whereof is ſpecified. The Arguments which overthrow the <hi>Popiſh</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of believers, being diſcharged from the guilt of ſin, but not the puniſhment, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together miſ-applyed by Mr. <hi>F.</hi> to the point in hand.</p>
               <p>P. 556, 557.<note place="margin">Mr. F.</note> 
                  <hi>HAD not the ſuſception of our ſins preceded, as the antecedent impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive cauſe of Chriſts ſufferings, he could neither be
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:95157:46"/>ſaid to be made ſin for us, nor to bear them, nor to have them laid upon him, nor to die for our offences, nor to be our ranſom: Nor could the inflicting of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings upon him have been either good in it ſelf, or an act of Rectoral juſtice in God, or have had any ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to his glory, or to the honour of his Law, or to deter ſinners from offending; yea, preclude once the conſideration of ſin, as the meritorious cauſe of the Agonies which Chriſt underwent, and the love, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, juſtice, and Rectorſhip of God, are obnoxious to reflections, and ſtand liable to be impeached. And if it be once obtained, that our ſins are the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous impulſive cauſe of Chriſts death, his ſuſception of our guilt will neceſſarily follow. For guilt being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an obligation to puniſhment, and it being impoſſible to conceive ſuch a habitude betwixt a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and ſin, that it ſhould be the meritorious impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive cauſe of his puniſhment, and yet he not be under an obligation to puniſhment, it plainly follows, that guilt muſt be ſuppoſed antecedent to a demerit of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Guilt and puniſhment being Relates, he that is obnoxious to the latter, muſt be previouſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Imputation of the former, as Biſhop</hi> Andrews <hi>expreſſeth it, Chriſt was firſt made ſin in reſpect of the guilt, and then a curſe in reſpect of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Serm. of Juſtification on <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Almoſt all of this, either in the ſame words, or in words to the ſame effect, hath been before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited out of this Author, and a reply accordingly ſhaped thereunto. And for that reaſon, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary only to repeat the Anſwers, which have been already given. I anſwer then,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt may very well be ſaid to be made ſin for us, to bear our ſins, to have them laid upon him, to die for our offences, and to be our ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, in that he did take upon him an obligation to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:95157:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſuffer, and ſuffer to death for the expiation of them, although it cannot be truly ſaid, That Chriſt did bear our ſin it ſelf [properly and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally taken] but only in the fruit and ſad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of it, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuffering equivalent puniſhment, to that which was due to us for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the Authors expreſſions [Antecedent Impulſive Cauſe]</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is the Authors miſtake, to confound an Antecedent Impulſive Cauſe with a Cauſe Merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. That he doth ſo, is moſt apparent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable by his fore-cited words. But that it is his miſtake ſo to do, be it conſidered,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the miſery of an indigent Creature, may be well ſaid to be an antecedent impulſive cauſe of that compaſſion, which is ſhewed towards it by thoſe, who are conſcious unto, or ſpectators of its miſery. And accordingly I doubt not to aver, That the miſerable effects of ſin, ſpecially in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us obnoxious to the vengeance of eternal fire, was an antecedent impulſive cauſe, moving God, (ſpeaking of him after the manner of men, which we muſt do, or elſe we can ſcarce ſay any thing of him) fore-ordain the ſufferings of our Lord Redeemer Chriſt Jeſus, whereby to reſcue us out of our wretched, and otherwiſe forlorn condition. Yet who will, or can juſtly ſay, That the miſery of a Creature, doth in a ſtrict or proper ſence me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the pity, whether of God or man? This if it did, pity would ſcarce deſerve the name of pity, I mean, it would not be ſo thank-worthy, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as that which is merited, deſerves little, if any thanks. Is a Labourer obliged to give his Maſter thanks for his wages, which he hath earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or merited? Miſery may be well ſaid to be <hi>Res apta nata;</hi> an object naturally fit to move mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95157:47"/>or to be an impelling cauſe thereunto, and yet not a Meritorious cauſe thereof, in the ſtrict and proper uſual ſence of the word Meritorious.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though I grant it as a truth, and a fit ſaying, That our miſery contracted by ſin, was an antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent impulſive cauſe of Gods mercy, in delivering up Chriſt for us all, nevertheleſs I do utterly deny, that our ſins were the Meritorious cauſe of Chriſts death, or ſufferings. I grant, that our ſins were the Occaſion of Chriſts ſufferings, but I deny, that our ſins did merit his ſufferings. And I have juſt and great cauſe ſo to do, foraſmuch as our Logick tells us, that there is a great difference betwixt an Occaſion and a Cauſe (truly ſo called) as this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor cannot but know very well. I remember the ſaying of <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Abiathar,</hi> 1 Sam. 22.22. <hi>I have occaſioned the death of all the perſons of thy fathers houſe;</hi> which notwithſtanding it could not be ſaid, That he had cauſed their death. In like ſort may we ſay to God, We have occaſioned thee to bruiſe the Son of thy love, and to put him to grief, we have been the occaſion of all his ſufferings; but we may not ſay, That our ſins did merit them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Foraſmuch as what this Author hath ſought, he cannot obtain, <hi>viz.</hi> an acknowledgment, That our ſins were the meritorious cauſe of Chriſts death; and foraſmuch as he makes this the ground of his following inferences, it is not therefore need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that I ſhould uſe many words in replying thereunto: For if the foundation of a building be removed, the ſuperſtructure falls of it ſelf, and without hands. Nevertheleſs I add,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Although I do deny, that our ſins were the meritorious cauſe of Chriſts ſufferings, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I do aſſert, that Chriſt was under An obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſuffer for our ſins. It is this Authors great
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95157:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>miſtake, not to diſtinguiſh in this conteſt, betwixt Chriſts obligation and Ours, whereas, as hath been aforeſaid, theſe are two obligations ſpecifically dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent; and all his inferences here are utterly groundleſs, <hi>e. g.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That Chriſt could not ſuffer, or be under An obligation to ſuffer, except he had been under, or had taken upon him, Our obligation to ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</item>
                  <item>2. That he could not elſe have been ſaid to bear our ſins, to be made ſin for us, to have our ſins laid upon him, to die for them, nor to be our ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom.</item>
                  <item>3. That without this, the inflicting of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon Chriſt, could not have been either good in it ſelf, or an act of Rectoral juſtice in God, or have had any tendency to his glory, or—All theſe inferences, I ſay, are altogether ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</item>
                  <item>4. I anſwer <hi>Ex abundanti,</hi> If our ſins could properly be ſaid to have merited Chriſts ſufferings, nevertheleſs it will not from thence follow, That we meriting, that he ſhould ſuffer, then he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did merit it, or took upon him the meriting thereof; and therefore although guilt, as he ſays, muſt be ſuppoſed antecedent to a demerit of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet where there is no ſuch demerit (as in Chriſt there was not) there 'tis not neceſſary to ſuppoſe any antecedent guilt: Nor indeed in any caſe, but where the perſon ſuffering is properly puniſh'd, which Chriſt was not, but only a ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of that, which we for our ſins deſerved to have ſuffered in our own perſons, and which if we had perſonally ſuffered, it would have been formally and properly a puniſhment to us; but was not to him, becauſe he never deſerved it, nor was any
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95157:48"/>ſuch guilt, or deſerving it imputed to him, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon him. And yet he may be ſaid in ſome improper ſence, to be obliged to puniſhment; I do not mean the word [improperly] in reference to Obliged (for Chriſts obligation to ſuffering, however it was not at all <hi>Obligatio Criminis,</hi> yet being truly <hi>Obligatio Contractus,</hi> it was therefore <hi>In ſuo genere,</hi> a proper obligation) but to the word [Puniſhment] and I do therefore expreſs the matter now plainly, and ſay, That Chriſt may be ſaid to be obliged to puniſhment improperly ſo called, becauſe he did voluntarily undertake, and obliged himſelf to ſuffer thoſe pains, which being inflicted on us, would have been properly, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per puniſhments.</item>
                  <item>5. As for the teſtimony of that renowned Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Andrews,</hi> I have made reply thereunto in an entire Chapter (<hi>Ch.</hi> 5.) and I have thought it my part the rather ſo to do, becauſe, as I perceive by my late reading, not Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> only, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain other Brethren, by their allegation of that ſaying of the Biſhop, have adopted it as their own.</item>
               </list>
               <p>There is but one paſſage more, which I have obſerved in my reading of his Book throughout, to refer to the matter in hand (The Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs to us, or our guilt to him) which becauſe it will not need any large reply, I will not aſſign a peculiar Chapter thereunto, but ſhall therewith cloſe both this Chapter, as alſo the whole of what I have here to animadvert upon, with reference to him.</p>
               <p>P. 577.<note place="margin">Mr: F.</note> 
                  <hi>Where ſin is ſo charged, as to expoſe a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to a demerit of puniſhment, there is an obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to it, and where there is ſuch an obligation to it, there is in ſome ſence or other, guilt. Thoſe very
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:95157:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>Arguments, whereby we overthrow the Popiſh Dogm of Believers, being diſcharged from the guilt of ſin, but not the puniſhment, do equally diſprove Chriſts undergoing the puniſhment of ſin, without ſuſception of the guilt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The word [demerit of puniſhment] is ambiguous; for it may ſignifie two things, <hi>viz.</hi> Either the meriting of puniſhment, or puniſhment it ſelf merited; in the latter ſence it's true, That our ſin was ſo charged upon Chriſt, as occaſional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to expoſe him to demerit of puniſhment <hi>(i.e.)</hi> to ſuffer the puniſhment, which was the demerit of our ſin, or which we by our ſin had merited; but in the former ſence it is a notorious untruth to ſay, That our ſin was ſo charged upon Chriſt, as to expoſe him to the demerit of puniſhment <hi>(i. e.)</hi> That he was charged with the meriting of any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thence it follows, That although there was an obligation upon Chriſt to ſuffer, yet not our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, nor any ſuch obligation as was ours, but an obligation of a different kind from ours, as hath ſeveral times upon occaſion been ſaid before.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Author ſpeaks at random, and not to the purpoſe in hand, in that his inference, ſaying, There is in ſome ſence or other, guilt: For as there are divers ſences of the word [Guilt] yea divers kinds of Guilt [Guilt of fault, and Guilt of, or obligation to puniſment] ſo the Queſtion in hand is not, Whether Chriſt did not take upon him Guilt in ſome ſence or other, nor whether he took upon him An obligation to puniſhment, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he took upon him that kind of Guilt at all, which is called Guilt of fact, or fault <hi>(i. e.)</hi> our deſerving to ſuffer, or due obligation to ſuffer what we by our ſin had deſerved.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I conceive, That the Popiſh doctrine here
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:95157:49"/>reflected on is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That Believers are diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the guilt of ſin, as to eternal puniſhment, by the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, yet not as to tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral puniſhments, but by ſatisfaction made by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but whatever the Popiſh doctrine be in this matter, I do utterly deny, that thoſe very Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereby we do overthrow that, or any other <hi>Dogmata</hi> of the Papiſts, do at all diſprove, what I my ſelf with other of my Brethren, do in this conteſt, aſſert, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt did undergo an obligation, to ſuffer the puniſhment, which we deſerved for our ſins, without any undergoing, or taking upon him our guilt, or deſerving thereof.

               <p>Reflections upon certain paſſages in Dr. <hi>J. Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en</hi>'s Book ſtyled <hi>(Communion with God)</hi> concerning Chriſt his being made ruddy in his own blood, Morally by the Imputation of ſin; and concerning that bleſſed Bartering and Exchange pretended by him, betwixt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers giving up their ſins to Chriſt, and their taking from him that Righteouſneſs, which he wrought for them. His obſcure, ambiguous, un-Scriptural phraſes reproved, and his miſtakes therein (according to obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſtruction) detected. An Objection anſwered, wherein a two-fold Taking or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of a thing is ſpecified, and applyed to the purpoſe in hand. His miſtake in affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Saints by giving up their ſins to Chriſt, and taking from him his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, do fulfil the whole of that in <hi>2 Cor. 5.21.</hi> The falſhood of the reaſon aſſerted by the <hi>Doctor,</hi> why thoſe, who ſaid, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> were diſappointed in their expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, inſtead whereof, the true reaſon or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are aſſigned. That for ſinners to plead their repentance and duties, is not to barter with themſelves only, to take Chriſts work out of his hand, and to aſcribe it to other things, or to ſay, their duties ſhall bear their iniquities (according as the <hi>Dr.</hi> miſconſtrues
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:95157:50"/>the matter) but it is in very deed and in true conſtruction, to put the work of their being actually ſaved, into the hand of Chriſt, and to keep it there. The manner of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Bartering with Chriſt laid open, if it may fitly be ſo ſtyled.</p>
               <p>MY work in the remainder of this Treatiſe, will be for the moſt part in anſwering of ſuch needful Queſtions, as are (ſo many as at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I can call to mind) incident to the ſubject in hand, which ſhall be diſtinctly propoſed and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the enſuing Chapters. Only I ſhall deſire the Reader to take notice (now I have in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner parted from Mr. <hi>F.</hi>) that what I have replyed to him, touching the Reciprocal Non-imputation of our ſin to Chriſt, and of Chriſts Righteouſneſs to us, in their formal and eſſential nature, or otherwiſe than in the curſed and bleſſed effects of the one and of the other, is alike ſubſervient for the refutation of ſeveral paſſages of Dr. <hi>J. Owen,</hi> (a partaker with Mr. <hi>F.</hi> in ſeveral miſtakes, and miſinterpretations of the ſacred Scriptures, as will be maniſeſted in certain Chapters, towards the cloſe of this Treatiſe) in his Book ſtyled, <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God,</hi> ſome whereof I will here relate, and reply to.</p>
               <p>P. 53. <hi>Chriſt was made ruddy</hi> (ſays the Doctor) <hi>in his own blood two ways,</hi> 1. <hi>Naturaly, in the powring out of his blood,</hi> Luk. 22.24. Joh. 19.34.2. <hi>Morally, by the Imputation of ſin, whoſe colour is red and crimſon,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21.</p>
               <p>P. 221. <hi>The Saints make an Actual commutation with the Lord Jeſus, as to their ſins and his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:95157:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Having ſaid, <hi>p.</hi> 222. That they do lay down their ſins at the croſs of Chriſt, upon his ſhoulders, he proceeds to expreſs this Commuting of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, their ſins with Chriſt, and his Righteouſneſs with them, in the following words, <hi>p.</hi> 223.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Having thus by faith given up their ſins to Chriſt, and ſeen God laying them all on him, they draw nigh, and take from him that Righteouſneſs, which he hath wrought out for them: So fulfilling the whole of that of the Apoſtle,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. He was made ſin for us, that we might become the Righteouſneſs of God in him. <hi>They conſider him tendring himſelf and his Righteouſneſs, to be their Righteouſneſs before God; they take it, and accept of it, and compleat this bleſſed bartering and exchange of faith. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, curſe, wrath, death, ſin as to its guilt, he took it all, and takes it all away</hi>—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> As to one of the paſſages here recited, I need not ſay much more, than what hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid in anſwer to Mr. <hi>F.</hi> wherein I have manifeſted what manner of guilt our Saviour took upon him. I will only ſay further, That I have with a complication of affections (grief and ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with a mixture alſo of ſome indignation and abhorrency) taken notice of three or four things in his expreſs words.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I obſerve, That in his aſſerting, that Chriſt was made red in his own blood, Morally by the Imputation of ſin, whoſe colour is red and crimſon, he ſeems to ſay with Mr. <hi>F.</hi> that Chriſt did take our ſin upon him not only in the puniſhment, but alſo in the guilt thereof. This, I ſay, ſeems to be his meaning.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the hainous nature or guilt of ſin, is ſet forth in Scripture by the Metaphor here uſed by him, of redneſs, like to that of crimſon or ſcarlet,</p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:95157:51"/>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe he ſays expreſly; not only that Chriſt took upon him Anger, Curſe, Wrath, Death, but ſin alſo as to its guilt; in which words, he makes the guilt of ſin a diſtinct thing from the puniſhment of it, which he expreſſeth in the four preceding words [Anger, Curſe, Wrath, and Death.] Now the contrary truth to this his meaning (if indeed he did mean as he ſpake) I have already made known in my anſwer to Mr. <hi>F.</hi> and to the words of Biſhop <hi>Andrews, Ch.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I obſerve his canting phraſes (laying down our ſins at the croſs of Chriſt, upon his ſhoulders, Commuting, Exchanging, Bartering, By faith Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving up our ſins to Chriſt, and Taking from him his Righteouſneſs) language obſcure, ambiguous, moſt alien from the Scripture, more fit to delude, than to edifie any common Reader or Hearer. And if any partial or leſs intelligent perſon, ſhall be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with the word (Canting) as in his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion <hi>Durus Sermo,</hi> a cenſure too harſh, I will for his ſatisfaction ſay as followeth:</p>
               <p n="1">1. As for the Doctor's expreſſion (The Saints giving up their ſins to Chriſt by faith, Laying down their ſins at his croſs, upon his ſhoulders) I know no ſuch ſayings in Scripture; and I do therefore judg them fit to be rejected, with words like thoſe of the Apoſtle in another caſe, <hi>The holy Scriptures have no ſuch cuſtom</hi> of ſpeaking, <hi>nor the Churches of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.16. And I do judg thus the rather, becauſe the inſpired Scriptures were given of God, to be attended unto as the rule of our ſpeaking, in and about the concernments of our ſoul, and matters of Religion, as well as of our thinking.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A bad meaning of the phraſes is very obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to any common underſtanding, That Chriſt
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:95157:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>did and will own our ſins in the ſimple guilt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or that our guilt of ſin was imputed to him by God, and being thus tendred to Chriſt, laid by us at his croſs, on his ſhoulders, will be welcomed and accepted by him as an acceptable offering, or as a grateful preſent; in which fond imagination we do wrong God and Chriſt, and do out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure flatter our ſelves, as hath been already mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The beſt conſtruction, which I can (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the utmoſt of my underſtanding) make, of the ſaid phraſes, is, That the Saints do verily believe, that Chriſt did bear their ſins in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved puniſhment thereof. And if the Doctor's meaning was no more than this, I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. We may believe this as an undoubted truth, and yet not be Saints. An hiſtorical faith (as it's uſually ſtyled) is not therefore neceſſarily a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying or ſaving faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was God himſelf, who did antecedently to our believing lay our ſins upon Chriſt <hi>(i.e.)</hi> in his ſuffering for them; but we do no where read in Scripture, that the Saints by their faith do lay their ſins upon him, although it is moſt true, that every ſinner ought to make a penitential confeſſion of his ſin to God, with faith in Chriſt, who was ſacrificed for them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſaid true conſtruction (if that indeed was the Doctor's meaning) is a thing ſo latent in his ſaid expreſſions, that without an Interpreter, could ſcarcely be found out. So that upon the hearing of ſuch uncouth phraſes, from the mouth of any Miniſter, well may the Auditors ſigh, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in alluſion to that in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. <hi>laſt. Ah Lord God, doth not the Preacher ſpeak Parables?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As for the Doctor's other expreſſions (<hi>The
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95157:52"/>Saints their taking from Chriſt that Righteouſneſs, which he hath wrought out for them, and his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring it to them, to be their Righteouſneſs before God)</hi> I ſay of them much-what as I did of the former, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. I do not remember and ſuch expreſs ſayings in Scripture, and I cannot therefore approve them as agreeable to the form of wholeſome words.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I ſee no reaſon, upon which in charity to preſume, that the Doctor had any good meaning in the ſaid phraſes <hi>(i. e.)</hi> that his <hi>particular</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein (for I judg him not for want of a good meaning in general, which a man may have both in ſpeaking falſly and doing wickedly, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.2.) was ſound and good: For it appears by the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of his Book, That he would have ſinners to believe, that that very Righteouſneſs, which Chriſt wrought for them, is in it <hi>ſelf</hi> tendred to them, and taken by them, and that it is in its eſſential nature imputed to them, and is their Righteouſneſs before God. I ſhall to this purpoſe in this place, tranſcribe onely one paſſage out of his Book, <hi>p.</hi> 200.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſays he, <hi>tenders his Righteouſneſs to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, declares the uſefulneſs and preciouſneſs thereof to their ſouls, ſtirs them up to a deſire and valuation of it, and laſtly, effectually beſtows it on them, rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning it to them as theirs, that they ſhould By it, and For it, and With it, be perfectly accepted with the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Scarce any thing can be more plainly ſpoken, as well in this, as in other paſſages of his Book (here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to be mentioned) from whence to conclude, That he aſſerts Chriſts Righteouſneſs it ſelf, or in it ſelf, to be imputed to ſinners, and that with the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:95157:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>Imputation of the very thing it ſelf,<note place="margin">Pardon of ſin in the blood of Chriſt being in truth a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in its kind, Believers may with it boldly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently make their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judgment ſeat of Chriſt. A Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor with the Kings pardon in his hand may boldly look his Judg in the face.</note> they are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or accepted with God; the error of which imagination I have already diſcovered, and ſhall ſpeak ſomewhat more of in <hi>Ch.</hi> 35. wherein I will manifeſt, that although figuratively <hi>(i. e.)</hi> in a cauſal ſence, Chriſts Righteouſneſs is a ſinners Righteouſneſs before God, nevertheleſs (to ſpeak properly) a ſinners perſonal Righteouſneſs, which conſiſts in his ſanctification and Remiſſion of ſin, is his Righteouſneſs before God. In the mean while, I ſhall aſſert this to be the plain truth of Scripture in this matter (even as in effect hath been before aſſerted by me upon occaſion) <hi>viz.</hi> That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſinners are juſtified before God, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him, By and For the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, as the meritorious cauſe thereof, but not With the Imputation of the thing it ſelf, or With the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt in it ſelf imputed to them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The beſt and only true conſtruction, that I can poſſibly make of the ſaid un-Scriptural phraſes, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Saints do take from Chriſt his Righteouſneſs, or the Righteouſneſs he wrought out for them, in the ſaving fruits or effects thereof; in which ſence a like phraſe is uſed, and was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon occaſion inſtanc't in 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. where, by the things which Believers had wrought, are not meant the very things themſelves, but the <hi>fruit</hi> or <hi>reward</hi> of them. But upon ſuppoſition of this true ſence of the ſaid phraſe or phraſes, I muſt ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Doctor and his Adherents, in this controverſie, concerning the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, will not own, or content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, with the bare truth of that conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:95157:53"/>
               <p n="2">2. Were the ſaid conſtruction the Doctor's true meaning, nevertheleſs I muſt needs ſay, That his expreſſion thereof is very un-ſcriptural, and upon that account, not ſuch as becomes the Oracles of God: For it is not the manner of thoſe divine Oracles to ſay, That Believers do by faith take Chriſts Righteouſneſs, in the ſaving fruit or effect of it, but that the bleſſed effect thereof Comes upon them; for which ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. <hi>As by the offence of one, judgment Came upon all men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, ſo by the Righteouſneſs of One, the free gift Came upon all men to the juſtification of life;</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.9. <hi>Cometh this Bleſſedneſs upon the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion only, or</hi>—</p>
               <p>Obj. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Believers being there ſaid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the end or reward</hi> (<hi>for ſo the word</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">Anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word <hi>(gnekeb)</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the like, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.33 and 19.11 in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer place in ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies an End, in the latter a Reward.</note> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>ſignifies,</hi> viz. <hi>both end and reward</hi>) <hi>of their faith, is not that all one, as to take it in the Doctor's ſence of the phraſe here uſed by him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No: For there is a two-fold taking or receiving of a thing, <hi>viz.</hi> Ethical and Phyſical, or Active and Paſſive, as it may be fitly expreſſed; the former implyes our duty, and is a taking or laying hold of a thing, by an act of faith or believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in which ſence it's taken in the Doctor's phraſe or expreſſion; the latter imports our feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and doth only imply our Having, Enjoying, or our being partakers of the thing, which we are ſaid to receive, in which Phyſical or Paſſive ſence it's taken in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. and in which ſence of the word (Receive) we are ſaid to Receive evil as well as good at Gods hand, <hi>Job.</hi> 2.10. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.27. <hi>Receiving in themſelves that recompence of their error, which was meet.</hi> And the word is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to <hi>things</hi> as well as <hi>perſons,</hi> Heb. 2.2. <hi>(Every tranſgreſſion Received a juſt recompence of reward)</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:95157:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>unleſs by ſins there we underſtand ſinners, <hi>Every Tranſgreſſion (i. e.)</hi> every Tranſgreſſor received— the abſtract being put for the concrete, a thing in Scripture not unuſual, as circumciſion for circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed; the ſame word alſo being uſed in the ſame ſence (Tranſgreſſions for Tranſgreſſors, as ſome think, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15.)</p>
               <p>Briefly, In ſuch a ſence as Believers are ſaid to Receive a Kingdom, which cannot be ſhaken, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28. they may truly be ſaid to Receive Chriſts Righteouſneſs <hi>(i. e.)</hi> to receive it in the benefit or fruit thereof; which fruit in the final upſhot, is indeed the Kingdom it ſelf there ſpoken of, and by which reception, is not there meant a Moral or Active Reception by the hand of faith, or action of believing (for it is not there commanded as a duty) but a Paſſive Reception (it being there mentioned as the bleſſed fruit of a divine promiſe) or Having it, as is the Apoſtles word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.22. <hi>You Have your fruit unto holineſs, and the end ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life;</hi> and <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.27. <hi>What ſhall we Have therefore?</hi> To which our Saviour anſwers, <hi>v.</hi> 29. <hi>You ſhall Receive an hundred-fold.</hi>—</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third thing, which I obſerve in the Doctor's words, is his Vanity, in calling the ſaid Commuting with Chriſt (their ſins with him, and his Righteouſneſs with them) A Bleſſed Bartering and Exchange: For Jeſus Chriſt doth not like, nor did he ever make offer of ſuch a bartering or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, as ſeems here to be intended by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>(i. e.)</hi> Chriſts taking to himſelf not only the puniſhment, but alſo the guilt of our ſins, and [in the way of exchange] our taking from Chriſt his Righteouſneſs it ſelf. This I have already mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted; ſo that although the Doctor hath in Gods name bleſſed ſuch a Bartering, Commuting, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:95157:54"/>nevertheleſs I may truly ſay, That ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners do no better than cheat themſelves, by ſuch vain imaginations and fancyful conceits. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon that admonition of the Apoſtle (<hi>Gal.</hi> 6.7.) is in this caſe to be minded, <hi>Be not deceived, God is not mocked.</hi> Though in commuting, exchanging, bartering commodities one with another, we may deceive and be deceived one by another, yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in the barter and exchange here ſpoken of, we may cozen and deceive our ſelves, yet God and Chriſt will not be ſo mocked or deceiv'd. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs I do acknowledg, that there is a kind of giving and receiving betwixt Chriſt and a ſinner, which if any one lift to call Bartering, may well and warrantably be ſtyled A <hi>Bleſſed</hi> Bartering, and what this kind of Bartering is, I will declare in my reply to another paſſage of the Doctor's, by and by to be recited, after I have intimated one thing more in his words fore-cited, wherein</p>
               <p n="4">4. I obſerve his miſtakes in ſaying, That by the ſaid Bartering, Believers do fulfil the whole of that of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Apoſtle by thoſe expreſſions doth not mean ſuch a Commutation, Exchange, or Barter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as aforeſaid, and it is a perverting of that Text, to affix ſuch a ſence thereunto, as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor doth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not true to ſay, That Believers by ought, that is, or can be done by them, do fulfil the whole of that Scripture; for it is God, who made Chriſt, and Chriſt, who made himſelf to be ſin for us, and this alſo antecedently to our believing; it is not Believers, who made him to be ſin for themſelves, or for any others. Yea, as the Apoſtle ſaid in another caſe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13. <hi>(If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful; he cannot deny himſelf)</hi> in like
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:95157:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſort may it here be truly ſaid, Although ſinners believe not, yet God ever was, and ſtill abideth faithful to fulfil, or verifie the whole of that of the Apoſtle, ſaying <hi>(God made him to be ſin for us, That we might be made—)</hi> together with that in <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. and other the like ſayings in Scripture, <hi>[God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.]</hi> Our unbelief (as the Apoſtle ſays elſewhere, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.3.) cannot <hi>make the faith of God without effect (i. e.)</hi> cannot hinder the fulfilling of his Word.</p>
               <p>The Doctor having pronounced the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation, to be a <hi>bleſſed Bartering and Exchange,</hi> proceeds to tell us, how much Jeſus Chriſt is therewith honoured, ſaying in the ſame Page,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Many indeed cry, Lord, Lord, and make mention of him, but honour him not at all. How ſo? They take his work out of his band, and aſcribe it unto other things; their repentance, their duties, ſhall bear their iniquities. They do not ſay ſo, they do ſo. The Commutation they make, if they make any, it is with themſelves. All their Bartering about ſin, is in and with their own ſouls. The work that Chriſt came to do in the world, was to bear our iniquities, and lay down his life a ranſom for our ſins.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Although it be very true (and a ſad truth it is) that many do cry, Lord, Lord, and do not honour him at all (yea do diſhonour him in ſo ſaying) yet it is no leſs falſe to ſay, as the Doctor hath here ſaid in his anſwer to the Queſtion, <hi>How ſo?</hi> For the reaſon is not, as he ſays, Becauſe they take Chriſts work out of his hand, and aſcribe it to other things, their repentance, and duties; but the true reaſon or reaſons thereof are ſuch as theſe:</p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:95157:55"/>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe perhaps they did never rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the work, which Chriſt did put into their hand <hi>(i. e.)</hi> which he did impoſe upon them, in order to their enjoyment of ſalvation, through his ſufferings, and blood-ſhed. It is thus with too many, who do deceive themſelves in thinking, that a form of godlineſs will ſufficiently ſerve for that end, although they deny the power thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe if they do know the work put into their hands, or impoſed upon them for that end, yet they will not do it <hi>(i. e.)</hi> they will not ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, as to repent and convert, that they may be ſaved.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſequently, becauſe they do aſcribe that to a form of godlineſs, or to the bare profeſſion of Chriſtianity, which through the mercy of God in Chriſt, is promiſed only to the power and practice of Chriſtian Religion. The truth of what I have herein anſwered to the ſaid Queſtion (How ſo?) and the falſhood of the Doctor's anſwer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, is apparent by that very Scripture in <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.21. —</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is evidently falſe, that thoſe vain and empty Profeſſors, did commute only with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and would have no bartering with Chriſt; for that they would fain have commuted with Chriſt, is apparent by their cloſing and ſcraping acquaintance with him, ſaying, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> or (to ſpeak in the Doctor's phraſe) by <hi>laying down their ſins at his croſs, upon his ſhoulders, who had born their iniquities.</hi> Theſe words uttered by their own mouthes (Lord, Lord) do audibly ſpeak their preſuming upon Chriſt to ſave them, or their making account, that Chriſt would barter with them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The truth of the reaſon or reaſons, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:95157:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſpecified by me, is moſt apparent alſo: For they did not repent, according as were their duty to have done, but they did continue to be workers of iniquity, as our Saviour tells them to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>v.</hi> 23. and upon that account he bad them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from him, not upon any ſuch account as the Doctor would have it, As if they would take Chriſts work out of his hands, and aſcribe it to their repentance (which was impoſſible for them to do, who did not repent, except through ſelf-deceit, in thinking they were penitent, whereas indeed they were not) and would have no barter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him, but with their own duties. So that if we will believe our Saviour Chriſt, we cannot believe what the Doctor hath ſaid, in anſwer to the ſaid Queſtion (How ſo?)</p>
               <p n="2">2. If thoſe carnal Profeſſors had indeed repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and converted from their iniquities, They might well and warrantably have pleaded their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and converſion, as a title (through the mercy of God in Chriſt) for their admittance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom of Heaven, ſaying, <hi>Lord, Lord, open unto us;</hi> inſtead of ſaying <hi>(Haſt not thou taught in our ſtreet, have not we eaten and drunk in thy preſence, in thy name caſt out devils—)</hi> they had been able to ſay with <hi>David, I have kept thy Word, I have been upright before thee, and have kept my ſelf from mine iniquity,</hi> or as <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> or <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> or St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of themſelves, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20.3. <hi>Neh.</hi> 14.22. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7. Chriſt would not doubtleſs have turn'd them going with that cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting word (Depart from me) but have ſaid for their comfort, as to the good ſervant, <hi>Well done good and faithful ſervants:</hi> For thus to have plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was not to take any work proper to Chriſt, out of Chriſts hand, or to aſcribe ought, that was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:95157:56"/>to Chriſt, to any other thing; which to have done, was far from thoſe Old Teſtament and New Teſtament Saints before-named. Did <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in that ſaying (<hi>Lord ſave me; for I am holy,</hi> Pſ. 86.2.) renounce all <hi>bartering</hi> with Chriſt, or take the work of his ſalvation out of Chriſts hands, or aſcribe that to his own perſonal holineſs, that was peculiar to the perſon of Chriſt? I trow not. Yea, for profeſſed Chriſtians in ſuch ſort to plead as aforeſaid, is in very deed to put the work of their ſalvation into the hands of Chriſt, who as he did by bearing their iniquities, purchaſe their being ſaved, conditionally upon their return to God through him, by faith and repentance, ſo he gives repentance to ſinners, that thereupon both he and they may be in a proximate, or moral capacity, he of pardoning and ſaving them, and they of being pardoned or ſaved by him. Briefly then, the ſin and folly of thoſe carnal Profeſſors was not, that they would not at all, or upon any terms Barter with Chriſt (only with themſelves) but that they would have bartered with Chriſt, with coyn not currant, or with counterfeit ware <hi>(i. e.)</hi> not with true repentance for ſin in the name of Chriſt, and converſion from it, but with an outſide pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſtianity, owning Chriſt profeſſedly as their Lord and Maſter, themſelves in the mean time being ſervants to, or workers of iniquity: For had they indeed parted from their ſins, they had never parted from Chriſt, nor would Chriſt have refuſed commuting with them, but would have given them the benefit of his Righteouſneſs, in exchange for their parting with their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs. And becauſe as our Saviour ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerning the <hi>worſhipping of God in Spirit and in truth,</hi> ſays <hi>(The Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:95157:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>him)</hi> ſo Chriſt himſelf ſeeketh ſuch Chapmen, as will forſake all their ſinful ways, that ſo they may win him, and the benefit of his Righteouſneſs; I will therefore ſpeak a few words, whereby to drive the bargain betwixt the Saviour and the ſinner; to which end my advice to every ſinner, is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth:</p>
               <p n="1">1. If ever you mean to drive a ſaving bargain with Chriſt, or by bartering with him, gain the benefit of his Righteouſneſs, you muſt know the market-rate, or (to ſpeak in the language of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.28.) <hi>You muſt ſit down, and count the coſt.</hi> And in the name of the living God, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you to take heed of thinking, That it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for you to lay down your ſins at the croſs of Chriſt, upon his ſhoulders, or to give up your ſins to Chriſt in the guilt of them, which ſome uſe to call, An applying of Chriſt to our ſelves: For if this be all, I may well ſay, in alluſion to thoſe words of our Saviour (<hi>Mat.</hi> 5.47.) <hi>What do you more than others?</hi> more than thoſe others, who ſaid, <hi>Lord, Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. You muſt rightly underſtand, what are the commodities, that Jeſus Chriſt doth offer or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and withal the true value and worth of them, they being the fruits of his Righteouſneſs [Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſin, Reconciliation with God, Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Juſtification unto life, Everlaſting ſalvation.] It is the office of Gods Miniſters, faithfully to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint ſinners, that although Chriſt hath done his work, in bearing the burden of their iniquities, in the puniſhment thereof, nevertheleſs there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain burden or yoke of duty, to which every ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is to ſubmit his neck and ſhoulders, that would have the benefit of Chriſts ſufferings actually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd upon him; which yoke and burden (for
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:95157:57"/>our comfort our Saviour aſſures us) <hi>is eaſie and light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. You muſt after a due deliberation, and count of the coſt, come to a fixed reſolution, to come up to the market-price, and to bid no leſs than Chriſt doth demand: For if we mean to <hi>barter</hi> with him, we muſt not think to bring him down to our terms (the wearing of his Livery, profeſſing his name, doing ſome more cheap, eaſie, external du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties—) but we muſt come up to his terms <hi>(i.e.)</hi> we muſt deny our ſelves, take up our croſs and follow him, as he hath from the beginning told us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24. For though we may cozen or cheat our ſelves, yet Chriſt will neither cozen us, nor would he, that we ſhould be cozened by our ſelves, or by any others.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let no man deceive you with vain words, as if the doing according to the foreſaid Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were a bartering with your ſelves, and not with Chriſt, or a taking of the work out of Chriſts hand, and aſcribing it to your own faithful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances: For this is but to do our own work under Chriſt, and by his helping grace; this is to be workers together with God; this is under Chriſt to do our own part, for the ſaving of our ſelves, which every ſinner muſt do, who expects to be ſaved through Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.40. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16. 'Tis true, as the Doctor ſays, That the work, which Chriſt came to do in the world, was to bear our iniquities, and to lay down his life a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom for our ſins; but withal it concerns us all to remember, that we have a work or works to do, that the benefit of that his ranſom and ſufferings may be ours, whereupon as to us they may not at laſt prove in vain, and we reproached, as thoſe who have <hi>rejected,</hi> or fruſtrated <hi>the counſel of God
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:95157:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>againſt our ſelves,</hi> Luk. 7.30. Our only work is not to give up our ſins to Chriſt, to lay them upon his ſhoulders, or to believe, that he hath born them. We can never barter, or commute with Chriſt meerly upon ſuch terms. Nor let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard ſuch vain words, as are here ſuggeſted by the Doctor, as if repenting for our ſins, and doing our duty, that we may be ſaved by Chriſt, were in effect to ſay, Our repentance, our duties, ſhall bear our iniquities. The truth is, in theſe four things,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether we repent, or not repent, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we do, or not do our duty, moſt undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſt hath born our iniquities.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If Chriſt had not born our iniquities, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we had done our duty in repenting, our repentance would have been to no ſaving purpoſe; for we muſt ſtill our ſelves have born our iniquities notwithſtanding.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though Chriſt hath born our iniquities, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs repentance for ſin, and converting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from to God in Chriſt, are our duties, and duties of ſuch indiſpenſable neceſſity, that unleſs we do repent and be converted, we our ſelves muſt bear our iniquities in the eternal puniſhment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To repent and to do our duty, that we may not our ſelves in this ſort bear our iniquities, is not in any rational conſtruction to ſay, as the Doctor, it ſeems, doth interpret it, That our repentance and duties ſhall bear our iniquities.</p>
               <p>I have been the more copious in anſwer to the ſaid paſſages of the Doctor, that I might preſerve, or reſcue the ſouls of men, from being enſnared thereby: And although I expect no thanks for my pains from many, but contempt and deriſion ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:95157:58"/>nevertheleſs foraſmuch as I look upon the ſaid paſſages, as dangerous gins and ſnares, ſuited in their own nature to entangle ſinners, inſtead of tending to their edification, in ought that is good, I ſhall not repent of this my work and labour of love.</p>
               <p>I will now proceed to the propoſal of ſuch uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Queſtions, as in the beginning of this Chapter, I intimated ſhould be the ſubject of ſeveral the Chapters following.</p>

               <p>In what ſence may it be truly ſaid, That we are intereſſed in Chriſts Merit or Satisfaction. In anſwer hereunto it is ſaid, That three things may poſſibly be meant, by the Merit or Satisfaction of Chriſt, which being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly ſpecified, the Queſtion is accordingly determined.</p>
               <p>FOraſmuch as ſuch ſayings as theſe, are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily heard from the mouthes, and to be ſeen in the printed Sermons of many popular Preachers <hi>(Believers are intereſſed in the Merits of Chriſt, They may lay claim to his Merits, Chriſts Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction is theirs, They may challenge it as their own—)</hi> and foraſmuch as ſuch ſayings, are by the common ſort of Hearers and Readers (not to mention any the Authors accuſtomed to ſuch words) either not at all underſtood, or miſ-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; and indeed foraſmuch as ſuch ſayings do
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:95157:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>need a due explication; as well therefore to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the truth, as to prevent error, in the minds of people, by their miſ-conceptions, I will propoſe, and anſwer the following Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>In what ſence may it be truly ſaid, That we are intereſſed in Chriſts merit and ſatisfaction, or, That we may challenge, and lay claim thereunto as Ours?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Although there hath been enough ſaid already, for a due reſolution of this, in the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the third Queſtion, nevertheleſs for the more abundant ſatisfaction of any, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may need it, I will anſwer thereunto, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p>There be three things, which poſſibly may be meant by the Merit and Satisfaction of Chriſt.
<list>
                     <item>1. Chriſts Righteouſneſs it ſelf, or his very do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſufferings themſelves, wherein his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs did conſiſt.</item>
                     <item>2. The valuableneſs, ſatisfactorineſs, or meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſneſs of that his Righteouſneſs and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</item>
                     <item>3. The thing or things, which by Chriſts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious obedience were merited.</item>
                  </list> Theſe three do differ in ſence and ſignification, as Efficient, Efficiency, and Effect; The firſt (Chriſts Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs or Obedience) hath the nature of an <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi> cauſe; The ſecond (the ſatisfactorineſs of Chriſts Obedience) of <hi>Cauſality;</hi> The third (the thing or things merited) of an <hi>Effect</hi> ſo cauſed. Now when we ſay, that we are intereſſed in Chriſts merit and ſatisfaction, that they are Ours, that they are imputed to us, or beſtowed upon us, the words (Merit or Satisfaction) are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:95157:59"/>in the third ſence of the words, and in neither of the two former ſences. If the Queſtion were thus formed or worded, What is the ſubject of Chriſts merit or ſatisfaction? It is truly to be anſwered,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. As merit is taken in the ſecond ſence, the ſubject thereof (I mean, <hi>Subjectum immediatum, ſeu inhaeſionis</hi>) is Chriſts merit or ſatisfaction, as taken in the firſt ſence of the words before ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For the worthineſs (the <hi>Vis aptitudinalis</hi>) or aptitude of Chriſts Righteouſneſs to merit or ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, hath to that his Righteouſneſs, the habitude of an Adjunct, even as the keenneſs of a Knife, or its aptitude to cut, hath to the Knife it ſelf the ſame kind of reſpect.</item>
                  <item>2. As merit or ſatisfaction is taken in the firſt ſence, yea alſo in the ſecond ſence of the words, as before ſpecified, ſo Chriſt himſelf is the ſubject thereof, I mean, <hi>Subjectum denominationis:</hi> In theſe two ſences, his Merit and Satisfaction is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his own Merit and Satisfaction, and ſo to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated, but not Ours, they being in the ſaid ſences of the words Incommunicable to us.</item>
                  <item>3. As Chriſts Merit or Satisfaction are taken in the third ſence of the words before-named, Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are the ſubject thereof; for they are the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who have intereſt in, or do partake of the ſaving fruits, effects, or benefits thereof, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by purchaſed. Now in this only ſence (in my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion) can Chriſts merit or ſatisfaction, be truly ſaid to be Ours, To be imputed to us, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon us, or we to have intereſt in it, or (as is the uſual expreſſion of ſome Preachers) to have it made over to us.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Briefly, In ſuch a ſence as Our Demerit may be
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:95157:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſaid to be Chriſts, ſo his Merit may be ſaid to be Ours. As the word [Merit] ſo the word Demerit may poſſibly mean three things;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The evil act, or action of ſinning.</item>
                  <item>2. The demeritoriouſneſs, or deſervingneſs of puniſhment, that doth neceſſarily adhere to that evil action.</item>
                  <item>3. The puniſhment it ſelf thereby deſerved. Now in the two former ſences of the word, a ſinners Demerit is his own and not Chriſts; nor did Chriſt ever aſſume to, or take upon himſelf our Demerit in any ſuch ſence, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the third ſence of the word, as that word doth import the puniſhment it ſelf, which we by our ſins had merited or deſerved.</item>

               <p>Queſt.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> None at all, ſo far as I have been able, by all that I have heard or read hitherunto, to comprehend: For what more doth a ſinner need, or can he in reaſon deſire to receive from God, or is he capable of receiving from God through Chriſt, than a free and full pardon of all his ſins, upon his faithful and penitential return to God in him? What more ſhould God do for a penitent and believing ſoul, than to be merciful to his ſins, or to him a ſinner (theſe are Scriptural expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Gods pardoning mercy, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 51.1. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.12.) for the Righteouſneſs ſake of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:95157:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>Chriſt, or the meritoriouſneſs thereof? Is there any thing beyond Heaven, that a believing ſinner, a ſanctified ſoul, can deſire? And what is it, that can keep a ſinner out of the Kingdom of Heaven, but ſin unpardoned? Sin retained, doth indeed keep the gate of Heaven faſt ſhut againſt us, by the arm of the Almighty; but ſin remitted, or the remiſſion of ſin, makes thoſe everlaſting doors to fly open, even as that iron gate did to <hi>Peter</hi> of its own accord, <hi>Act.</hi> 12.10. whereupon to every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned ſoul, there is an <hi>entrance miniſtred abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, into the everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> I know no benefit, that a ſinner is capable of receiving, by any imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, beyond what hath been ſaid, he doth, or ſhall enjoy, through the pardon of his ſin, unleſs we ſhall account it a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to be Chriſted with Chriſt; a benefit, which as I do not underſtand, ſo neither do I think it to have any exiſtence, otherwiſe than as of old, in the brains of <hi>Jacob Behmen,</hi> and <hi>Henry Nicols,</hi> ſo in thoſe their followers, ſtyled, <hi>The Tribe or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of Love,</hi> who have infer'd Our being Chriſted with Chriſt, from ſuch an Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs unto us, which being by many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers unwarrantably aſſerted, is in this Treatiſe deſervedly diſclaimed and oppoſed. I do here call to mind the words of the very learned Doctor <hi>Henry More,</hi> very pertinent to the preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If you preſcind it</hi> (ſays he) <hi>from remiſſion of ſin, through the ſacrifice of Chriſt on the Croſs, this phraſe</hi> Imputative Righteouſneſs, <hi>hath no ſignification at all, and that therefore there is no damage done to our Religion, if it be not accounted a diſtinct Article, from the Remiſſion of ſins in the blood of Chriſt: For
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:95157:61"/>it cannot afford any true and uſeful ſence diſtinct there-from, nay I may ſay, any that is not miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and dangerous, and ſuch as tends to that loathſom and peſtilential error of</hi> Antinomia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm.</p>
               <p>The premiſſes conſidered, there is juſt cauſe to conclude, that thoſe Miniſters, who without af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of new phraſes, and modes of ſpeaking, do love ſtill to utter <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Object. <hi>But do not the contrary minded pretend, that Juſtification, by the Imputation of Chriſts Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs it ſelf to a ſinner, is a greater benefit, than remiſſion of ſin, and that alſo, which a ſinner, over and above the pardon of his ſin, hath abſolute need of, in order to his admittance into the Kingdom of Heaven?</hi>

               <p>One benefit pretended by divers, That by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin, a ſinner is freed from the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment deſerved by his fault, but by Chriſts Righteouſneſs imputed, he is freed from the fault it ſelf, the vanity of which pretence is diſcovered. Several Objections anſwered, wherein is ſhewen, That a ſinner may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliged from ſuffering, the puniſhment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for his fault, and yet remain faulty ſtill; and that it is repugnant to the nature, as well as to the Law of God, for God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute a ſinner to be that, which he is not, or not to have committed thoſe faults, which he hath committed. That it is one thing for God to repute a perſon to be innocent, and quite another to be dealt with reſpectively to impunity as innocent. In what ſence a Thief having made ſatisfaction for his theft, is in the ſence of the Law a Thief ſtill. The main ground of miſtake in this matter ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p n="1">1. IT is pretended, that by remiſſion of ſin, the ſinner is freed from the puniſhment deſerved by his fault, but by his juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, through Chriſts Righteouſneſs imputed to him, he is freed from faultineſs, or the fault it ſelf. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſaith Mr. <hi>John Warner,</hi> in his Book ſtyled, <hi>Diatriba Fidei juſtificantis qua juſtificantis,</hi> printed
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:95157:62"/>in the year 1657, the Book it ſelf being chiefly written, in oppoſition to Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> and my ſelf, as to ſeveral paſſages in my Exercitation, concerning the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of forgiveneſs of ſin.</p>
               <p>His words, <hi>p.</hi> 139. are theſe; <hi>Whereas pardon of ſin doth take away</hi> Reatum poenae, <hi>juſtification doth conſtitute a man ſo righteous, as to take away</hi> Reatum culpae.</p>
               <p>To the ſame purpoſe I have read in another Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, who ſays, <hi>That whereas remiſſion of ſin takes away the puniſhment, juſtification takes away the fault, ſo that the Law hath no power to pronounce us faulty.</hi> So Mr. <hi>Anth. Burges</hi> of Juſt. 2d. part, <hi>p.</hi> 268.</p>
               <p>As for the vanity of this pretence, I have ſaid enough already, partly in this Treatiſe, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the 4th. Chapter of my Exercitation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Nature of forgiveneſs of ſin, and if need be, am ready to ſay more, for the diſcovery thereof. And for the better underſtanding of the matter, let the difference betwixt Guilt of fault, and Guilt of puniſhment, be rightly underſtood, and ſtill remembred, <hi>viz.</hi> That theſe two do differ <hi>Sicut Meritum poenae,</hi> and <hi>Obligatio ad luendum poenam,</hi> in the former ſence he is guilty, who hath committed a fault, and thereby hath deſerved pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, but in the latter ſence he only is guilty, that remains actually obliged to ſuffer the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he by his fault had deſerved. Now (as I have ſaid before) as Chriſts Righteouſneſs is no more, or otherwiſe imputed to a ſinner, for his juſtification, than his pardon, ſo alſo his juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth ſtand him in no more ſtead than doth his pardon; albeit Juſtification doth [even as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin] take away the guilt of puniſhment,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:95157:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>yet it neither doth, nor can take away the guilt of fault, or faultineſs it ſelf, from the ſinner; ſo that albeit the Law cannot pronounce a ſinner, who is juſtified, to be guilty, as a perſon actually obliged to ſuffer for his fault, yet it may, and doth, and cannot otherwiſe chooſe but pronounce him faulty, or guilty of fault; yea the Law, in its expreſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing a perſon to be pardoned, juſtified, or not guilty of puniſhment, doth implicitly pronounce him to be guilty of fault. So true are thoſe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>Quod factum eſt, fieri infectum non poteſt. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere eripitur, habuiſſe nunquam, it a peccare ceſſat, peccaviſſe nunquam.</hi> Hereupon it, was moſt truly ſaid by the Poet,</p>
               <q>—Ne non peccârim, Mors quo<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> non faciet.</q>
               <p>But becauſe I am well aſſured, that Mr. <hi>Warner</hi> and Mr. <hi>Burgeſs</hi> are not alone in that their miſtake, as aforeſaid, I will therefore relate certain paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which I have ſomewhere read, objected againſt the truth here; and in the 4th. Chapter of my ſaid Exercitation aſſerted, and return anſwer thereunto.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Either in forgiving ſin, God muſt</hi> Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantem non peccantem facere, <hi>or elſe he doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If this be true, that God in forgiving ſin, doth make a ſinner to be no ſinner, or of faulty not faulty, then there is no difference at all as to this particular, betwixt forgiveneſs of ſin and juſtification, ſeeing God in forgiving the ſinner, as well as in juſtifying him, doth make him no ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>(i. e.)</hi> not faulty, or culpable.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Gods taking off the obligation to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is in order to his making</hi> Peccantem non pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantem
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:95157:63"/>
                  <hi>(i. e.) a ſinner to be no ſinner?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny, that Gods taking off a ſinners obligation to puniſhment, is in order to any ſuch matter, as is here pretended: For his taking off a ſinners obligation to puniſhment, is in order to his non-inflicting, or his actual taking off the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelf, in his appointed time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If it were truly ſaid, that Gods taking off a ſinners obligation to puniſhment, were in order to his making of a perſon faulty not faulty, then the difference betwixt remiſſion of ſin and juſtification, cannot be as is here pretended.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>As long as a ſinner is faulty, he is ſtill obliged to puniſhment?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Woe be to us, if this be true. For if there be truth in that ſaying, we have all cauſe to ſay with the Diſciples, <hi>Who then can be ſaved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Be it known to ſinners, for their great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation in Chriſt, that what is here objected, is a notorious miſtake; the very truth being this, <hi>viz.</hi> That a ſinner may be diſobliged from ſuffering the puniſhment deſerved by his fault, even when, and while he ſtands faulty, yea although to all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he doth ſtand faulty; and in very deed, every pardoned or juſtified ſinner ſhall ſo ſtand before God, it being a thing ſimply impoſſible, but that he, who is pardoned or juſtified by Gods free grace, through the Redemption which is in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhould remain faulty or culpable, as to his former ſins, even unto all eternity.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>It is not a contradiction to ſay, A ſinner may become no ſinner in Gods account, or by Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that being done for him, and made over to him, which be ſhould have done himſelf?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Whereas the Scripture tell us, that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:95157:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>Chriſt is <hi>our Mediator and Advocate with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> this Objection ſuppoſeth him to have been our Mandatory, Proxie, or Delegate, and that Chriſts doings were ſo done for us, and in ſuch a ſence made over to us, as that God imputes the very things done, or the very doing of the things themſelves unto us, the error of which imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I have already ſufficiently (as I hope) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As a perſon having ſin'd, or committed a fault, is thereupon to be denominated a ſinner, even ſo doth God ſtill from thence forward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of him, neither is it poſſible, that God ſhould upon any account whatſoever, repute him otherwiſe than as a perſon faulty: For look upon what account any one ſhall affirm, that God doth repute any ſuch perſon not faulty, he muſt upon the ſame account attribute to the All-ſeeing God a miſtaken judgment <hi>(i. e.)</hi> to repute a perſon to be ſuch a manner of perſon, as indeed he is not, or not to have committed the fault or faults, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he hath.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As it is a contradiction for any one to ſay, That what is done, was never done, ſo it is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious untruth to ſay, That God reputes a man not to have done the faults, which he hath done, or not to have thereby deſerved, what he hath deſerved.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>What difference is there betwixt being imputed innocent, and</hi> dealt <hi>with as innocent? And if juſtified perſons be accounted innocent, then their faultineſs is done away by Imputation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. There is a plain difference betwixt imputed (I think, the Objector would or ſhould have ſaid reputed) innocent, and dealt with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively to impunity, as innocent: For the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:95157:64"/>doth imply, that the perſon is eſteemed to have committed no fault, and thereupon that he is juſtified by works, the latter doth imply, that although a perſon be a ſinner, yet his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is remitted, and that he is juſtified by free grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Perſons that are juſtified by grace, or with a Goſpel-kind of juſtification, are not accounted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent (for upon the account of innocency, they muſt be juſtified by works and not by grace) and conſequently their faultineſs is not done away, by any imaginary imputation whatſoever.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is one thing for God to repute a man In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and quite another thing for God to repute him <hi>As</hi> Innocent: For, for God to repute a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Innocent, is to repute him to have committed no fault; but for God to repute a perſon <hi>As</hi> Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, is for God to pardon him, or not puniſh him for his faults, but to deal with him as one, who never committed any.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Though I readily grant, that the faults of a perſon pardoned, or juſtified, are done away, as to the Non-imputation of guilt of puniſhment (in which reſpect, their pardon or juſtification is ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Non-imputation of their faults to them, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 32.2. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18.) nevertheleſs I muſt ſtill deny, that the faultineſs of ſuch a perſon is done away, and affirm the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That his faultineſs, or his ſin in the faultineſs thereof, is ſtill imputed to him <hi>(i. e.)</hi> that he is ſtill reputed by God, to have done or committed a fault, and thereby to have deſerved puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Though in juſtifying a ſinner, God doth not</hi> Peccata non peccata facere, <hi>yet he may</hi> Peccan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem non peccantem facere?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe God cannot do the former,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95157:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>therefore he cannot do the latter: For <hi>Peccatum</hi> and <hi>Peccans</hi> being <hi>Conjugata,</hi> it doth neceſſarily follow, that whoſoever doth <hi>Peccantem non Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantem facere,</hi> he muſt in order thereunto, <hi>Pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum non Peccatum facere;</hi> for <hi>that</hi> cannot be done without this: A man cannot of <hi>Peccans</hi> be made <hi>Non Peccans,</hi> till that his <hi>Peccatum</hi> be made <hi>Non Peccatum. Peccatum</hi> muſt be undenominated <hi>Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum,</hi> or denominated <hi>Non Peccatum,</hi> before <hi>Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> can poſſibly be undenominated <hi>Peccans,</hi> or denominated <hi>Non Peccans.</hi> I conclude therefore, that in his pardoning or juſtifying a ſinner, God doth not, yea cannot, do either of the ſaid things, I ſay, Cannot, becauſe it implyes a contradiction, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> to make one, that hath ſin'd, not to have ſin'd, or that, which once was a ſin, not to have been a ſin.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>A Thief having made ſatisfaction for his fault, is in the ſence of the Law no longer a Thief, or faulty as to theft, and ſo it is in the caſe of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners juſtification?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I readily both give and grant, that look how it is with a Thief, who by himſelf hath made legal ſatisfaction for his fault, ſo it is with a juſtified ſinner (I ſay not, who hath made ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for himſelf in or by Chriſt, but) for whom Chriſt hath made ſatisfaction, and which ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as ſo made by Chriſt, God hath accepted: And the caſe of both I judg to be this, <hi>viz.</hi> That although both of them do ſtill remain faulty, or <hi>Rei culpoe,</hi> yet neither of them are <hi>Obligati ad poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam (i. e.)</hi> actually obliged to ſuffer the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment deſerved by, or for their faults.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe words (A Thief, that hath ſatisfied for his fault, is in the ſence of the Law no longer a Thief) are ambiguous: For as the word Thief
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:95157:65"/>may ſignifie two things, <hi>viz.</hi> One that hath ſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, and one that is liable, or obliged to ſuffer for his theft, ſo the foreſaid words may ſignifie, either that the Law cannot ſay, That ſuch a one hath ſtollen, or, That ſuch a one is liable, or obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to be condemned. Now although the ſaid Thief, who hath made legal ſatisfaction, be in the ſence of the Law no longer a Thief, in the latter ſence of the word [Thief] yet he ſtill is a Thief in the former ſence of the word, and ſhall be ſtill ſo ſenced by the Law, even ſo long till theft be no theft, or the Law become never to have been a Law, or till that which is once done, ſhall become a thing that never was done.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>The faultineſs of the</hi> ſin, <hi>and of the</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>from that</hi> ſin, <hi>are two things, the act of theft will be theft, but the perſon committing that, though once a Thief, yet having ſatisfied the Law, in the ſence of that Law is become no Thief?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This in part hath been already an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, in my reply to the Objection immediately foregoing, wherein hath been declared, in what ſence of the word Thief, the ſaid perſon is in the face of the Law looked upon as no Thief, and yet ſtill as a Thief <hi>(i. e.)</hi> though not as one, who is obliged to ſuffer for his theft, yet as one, who hath ſtollen or committed theft.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I deny, that the faultineſs of the ſin, and of the perſon reſulting from that ſin, are two things, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> two ſeparable things, as the Objector pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends: For there is not one faultineſs of the ſin, and another of the perſon, nor can the faultineſs of theft, or of any other ſin, be ſeparated from the perſon of him, who hath committed ſuch ſins; the faultineſs of ſuch ſins, will in the ſimple faultineſs thereof, reſult upon the perſons of ſuch ſinners,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:95157:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſo long as <hi>Peccans</hi> and <hi>Peccatum, Furtum</hi> and <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi> are <hi>Conjugata.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. One ſpecial reaſon, why ſome do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their miſtake in this pretended difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt remiſſion of ſin and juſtification (they aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remiſſion takes away the puniſhment, but juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication the fault) ſeems to be this, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe they do not diſcern, or mind the difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt that two-fold guilt of ſin, which upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion hath oft-times before been mentioned, and once at leaſt explicated [Guilt of fault, and of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment] this being one main difference betwixt them, <hi>viz.</hi> That guilt of puniſhment is a thing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from the ſinner, but the guilt of fault not ſo: For although it be moſt true, that ſatisfaction being made for a fault (which was the caſe here ſuppos'd) the fault doth not <hi>Redundare in perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam (i. e.)</hi> reſult upon the criminal, in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment thereof (this being the caſe of every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, or juſtified ſinner) nevertheleſs the <hi>Reatus ſimplex,</hi> faultineſs it ſelf (this being a thing inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from the ſin and ſinner) doth ſtill reſult upon him, and ſhall abide upon him, till ſuch time as the foreſaid contradictions can be verified, which will be <hi>Ad Groecas Calendas,</hi> neither in this world, nor in the world to come.</p>
               <p>Thus have I anſwered to what I ever hitherto have read, touching the firſt grand benefit, which is pretended to be in a ſinners juſtification, by the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs unto him, over and above that, which doth conſiſt in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of his ſin. I proceed to the mention of another, which ſhall be the ſubject of the next Chapter.</p>

               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:95157:66"/>
               <head>CHAP. XXII.</head>
               <p>Another benefit pretended to be had by Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, through Chriſts Righteouſneſs impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, over and above the pardon of our ſins is, That remiſſion of ſin doth take off a ſinners obligation to puniſhment, but juſtification by Chriſts Righteouſneſs imputed, doth put him into a ſtate of favour and acceptation with God, the vanity of which pretence is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. The definition of Juſtification, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the late Aſſembly of Divines, in their leſſer Catechiſm explicated, ſo as to reconcile it with the truth of Scripture, though not from tautology. Three main grounds of the miſtake, in the difference here pretended, to be betwixt remiſſion of ſin, and juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Second benefit pretended to be had by ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, through Chriſts imputed Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, over and above the pardon of our ſins, is this, That remiſſion of ſin doth take off a ſinners obligation to puniſhment, but juſtification puts him into a ſtate of favour and acceptation with God.</p>
               <p>To this pretence I reply,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Foraſmuch as the puniſhment of ſin is priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive as well as poſitive, of loſs as well as of ſence, (as are the common expreſſions) and foraſmuch as the loſs, or privation of a ſinners favour and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:95157:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>with God, is one part of that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is threatned for ſin, it cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be otherwiſe, but that if the puniſhment of our ſins, through a pardon be remitted, but that our perſons ſhould be accepted, and reſtored into favour with God. To this purpoſe it is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that Reconciliation with God, and remiſſion of ſin, are uſed in Scripture as terms Synonimous, or of the ſame importance; reconciliation with God, being a part at leaſt of remiſſion of ſin; for proof whereof, ſee 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. where <hi>Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling the world to himſelf,</hi> is ſaid to be his not <hi>imputing to them their treſpaſſes,</hi> which non-impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is (as hath been before-ſaid) all one with remiſſion of ſin. See alſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. and 9.12. where we find it to be all one, for Chriſt to make reconciliation for ſinners, as to purchaſe remiſſion, or redemption for them. See <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.11. To receive remiſſion of ſin, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive atonement or reconciliation with God, are there mentioned as the ſame thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I deſire the Reader to conſider, whether, if a ſinner through the remiſſion of his ſins, be not brought into an eſtate of favour and acceptation with God,<note place="margin">Pſal. 32.1.</note> the Pſalmiſt had ſufficient ground to pronounce a ſinner bleſſed, upon the account of the forgiveneſs of his ſins. Had not remiſſion of ſin, in its very nature, implyed the acceptation of our perſons with God, the Pſalmiſt would doubtleſs not have ſaid, as there he doth once and again, <hi>[Bleſſed is the man, whoſe iniquities are forgiven, and whoſe ſins are covered, and Bleſſed is the man, to whom the Lord imputeth no iniquity.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Do not the late Aſſembly of Divines, make juſtification to be more than remiſſion of ſin, as ſeems by that deſcription of juſtification, which in
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:95157:67"/>their leſſer Catechiſm, is by them deſcribed to be An act of Gods free grace, wherein he pardoneth all our ſins, and accepteth us as righteous in his ſight, for the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to us</hi>—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That God accepts us as righteous, for the righteouſneſs ſake of Chriſt, is the truth of Scripture, and a truth worthy of all acceptation; but that this is for the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us, no Scripture doth expreſly affirm, and foraſmuch as thoſe Divines do not explain the meaning of that their ſaying, I am willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue it, in ſuch a ſence as agrees with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and as hath been opened in the third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Treatiſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I am willing alſo to make ſuch a conſtruction of thoſe additional words, in their deſcription of juſtification (And accepteth us as righteous in the ſight of God) as to reconcile them to the truth of Scripture; and the beſt conſtruction, that poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly (to my underſtanding) can be made thereof, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That thoſe words are a meer tautolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. Gods pardoning us, is all one with his cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us from all unrighteouſneſs; whereupon be it ſeriouſly conſidered, How God can be ſaid to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs, and not <hi>eo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> accept us in his ſight as righteous: For there being ſins of omiſſion, as well as commiſſion, if God pardon the former, as well as the latter, he muſt of neceſſity accept of our perſons as righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; for as by pardoning a ſinner his ſins of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, he accepts of him as a perſon, that hath done no evil, ſo by pardoning him his ſins of omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, God accepts him as a perſon, that hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed all good, and what is this, but to accept him as righteous, poſitively righteous? There needs no more therefore to righteouſneſs, than par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:95157:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>of ſin: For that which puts an offendor into ſuch a ſtate, as if he had broken the Law in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and had performed it in every thing, that doth neceſſarily juſtifie, or conſtitute him righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p>The premiſſes conſidered, it doth evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, That to ſay, By the remiſſion of our ſins, God diſchargeth us from the puniſhment of them, and by juſtification he accepts us as Righteous, is all one as to ſay, That by remiſſion of ſin God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth, or diſchargeth us from our ſins of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and by Juſtification he pardoneth, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth us from our ſins of Omiſſion; and how unreaſonable this aſſertion is, it's eaſie to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
               <p>The main grounds of the difference in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, pretended to be betwixt remiſſion of ſin and Juſtification, ſeem to be theſe:
<list>
                     <item>1. Becauſe ſuch pretenders do not conſider, that there are ſins of Omiſſion, as well as of Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that whenſoever, or to whomſoever God pardons the one, he pardons the other.</item>
                     <item>2. Becauſe they fancy an Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs to a ſinner, in or towards his juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which is not towards, or in order to his pardon; whereas it is the undoubted truth of Scripture, that Chriſts Righteouſneſs is no more, or otherwiſe imputed for, or in order to the one, than the other.</item>
                     <item>3. Becauſe they fancy ſuch a kind of Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, or that it is in ſuch a ſence imputed to a ſinner in his juſtification (they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it not the <hi>Medium</hi> unto a ſinners righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but the very thing it ſelf) as is repugnant both to reaſon, and Scripture.</item>

               <p>A third benefit pretended by a ſinners juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, through Chriſts imputed Righteouſneſs, over and above remiſſion of ſin is, That this latter doth only free the ſinner from eternal death, but juſtification doth moreover inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle him to eternal life, the vanity of which pretence is diſcovered; with an anſwer to what is objected to the contrary by Mr. <hi>Anth. Burges.</hi> An Anſwer alſo to the Queſtion, Whether believing ſinners are not reſtored by Chriſt, unto a greater degree of felicity, by their juſtification through Chriſts Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (ſuppoſing the Imputation of it) than upon the bare ſcore of the forgiveneſs of their ſins? The Contradictions of Mr. <hi>Anth. Burges,</hi> in certain particulars inſtanc'd in.</p>
               <p>A Third benefit (much-what of affinity with that in the foregoing Chapter) pretended by a ſinners juſtification, through Chriſts imputed Righteouſneſs, over and above the Remiſſion of his ſins, is, That remiſſion of ſin doth only free a ſinner from eternal death, but juſtification doth more <hi>(i. e.)</hi> it entitles him to eternal life.</p>
               <p>To this I reply. That the thing here pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, hath been indeed aſſerted by ſeveral Writers and Preachers; but for the diſcovery of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake therein, I need not ſay much more, than to deſire the Reader to reflect upon what hath been
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:95157:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>already ſaid, ſpecially in the foregoing Chapter, and withal to conſider, That foraſmuch as the loſs, or forfeiture of our title to life, is one part of the deſerved puniſhment of ſin, it muſt needs follow, that a ſinners deſerved puniſhment being remitted through a pardon, he is <hi>Ipſo facto</hi> and <hi>eo nomine,</hi> reſtored unto that title to life eternal, which by his ſin he had loſt or forfeited. If a ſinner being obliged to loſe heaven, and to be caſt into hell for his ſin, ſhall be once pardoned, through the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of that his obligation, by a pardon he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>In ſtatu quo prius,</hi> he hath right to impuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of both kinds, I mean, to freedom from hell, and to the enjoyment of heaven. If the loſs of the enjoyment of God be puniſhment of its kind (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led therefore <hi>Poena damni</hi>) then doth pardon of ſin reſtore right to that enjoyment of God, elſe the ſinner is not fully pardoned, no more than juſtified, as if a Traytor or Murderer be pardoned, yet muſt loſe his goods, he is then pardoned as to his life and lands, but not as to his goods. So that a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſo far forth as he is pardoned, he is juſtified, there being no more in the juſtification of an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, than pardon of ſin, as to the form, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal nature of the thing.</p>
               <p>I will ſpend this Chapter in anſwering ſuch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, as I have ſeen alledged, for the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening of the ſaid vain pretence, and ſhall begin with Mr. <hi>Anthony Burges.</hi> He ſaith in his Book of Juſtification, the ſecond part:</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>It follows not, where all evil is removed in a ſubject capable, all good is introduced (if a man ſhall not be damned, he muſt be ſaved) for though theſe are inſeparable, yet this doth not follow</hi> Ex na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turâ rei, <hi>but extrinſecally by the order and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, becauſe God might have delivered a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:95157:69"/>from hell, and yet have annihilated him, as a King may forgive a Malefactor by ſparing his life, and yet not admit him for a Courtier, and make him a Favourite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Is not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation an eternal evil? Why then doth this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, or how can he in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a perſon pardoned to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging withal, that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin doth remove the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal evil, that was deſerved?</note>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Although I grant, That hell-tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are one thing, and the annihilating of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is another, yet I muſt needs ſay, That this learned Author, with certain others, do ſpeak af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſtrange rate, or notion of pardon, who do ſpeak of a perſon pardoned, or diſobliged from puniſhment, and yet will ſuppoſe him to be anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated: For to ſuppoſe him to be annihilated, is to ſuppoſe him not to be pardoned, but puniſhed, and that ſeverely too.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They, who ſay, That God might have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſinner from eternal death, and then by anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation have rendred him uncapable of eternal life, do in plain conſequence ſay, That God might have pardoned a ſinner, and then have puniſhed him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though I yield theſe three things;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That Annihilation is rather to be choſen, than hell, That <hi>Praeſtat non eſſe, quam ſemper mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerum eſſe.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. That upon that account, a ſinner ſet free from hell, and yet annihilated, may be ſaid to be pardoned in a diminutive ſence, that is, to halves, or comparatively with himſelf, if he had been caſt into that lake, which burneth with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone for ever.</item>
                  <item>3. That God in his ſoveraignty, or by vertue of his abſolute dominion, or <hi>à priori,</hi> might, if he had ſo pleaſed, have in ſuch ſort pardoned a ſinner to halves by annihilation. This I yield: For as it is in Gods power to pardon a ſinner upon what terms, in what way, and at what time, ſo alſo
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:95157:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>how far forth, or in what degrees it ſeemeth good to his divine wiſdom and pleaſure.</item>
               </list>
               <p>But theſe Conceſſions notwithſtanding, be it conſidered, That God hath in his Word revealed his divine will and pleaſure in this point, <hi>viz.</hi> That he is ſo well pleaſed with the ſatisfaction of his only begotten Son (Jeſus Chriſt our Lord) as to promiſe unto, and in due time to beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on believing ſinners, not a partial pardon, but a full and plenary pardon of ſin; and from this ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary pardon ſo promiſed, according to Gods good pleaſure, it doth, I ſay, neceſſarily follow, That if a ſinner be pardoned with that pardon, which the Goſpel promiſeth, and which alone is here in queſtion, he is <hi>Ipſo facto,</hi> reſtored into Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and fatherly acceptation, and entitled to life eternal.</p>
               <p>The premiſſes conſidered, I infer theſe three or four Concluſions:
<list>
                     <item>1. That upon the removal of eternal evil from a perſon, who is pardoned, eternal good is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately introduced, by Gods order and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</item>
                     <item>2. That to grant (as the Objector here doth) that forgiveneſs of ſin doth remove the eternal evil, is to yield the cauſe, and to acknowledg, that by Gods order and appointment, forgiveneſs of ſin doth introduce eternal good, or a title to eternal life.</item>
                     <item>3. That if we do ſuppoſe a ſinner pardoned, to be only freed from hell, and then annihilated, we do even then, therein, and thereby, ſuppoſe him not pardoned according to the tenor of the Goſpel, or with ſuch a plenary pardon as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel promiſeth; and conſequently, that to argue after ſuch a rate, as is here argued, is to forſake,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:95157:70"/>or to depart from the ſubject of the Queſtion, a thing much unbeſeeming a cloſe Diſputant, ſuch as this Author was by many accounted.</item>
                     <item>4. That it is a groundleſs imagination to think, as too too many do, who having firſt unneceſſarily diſtinguiſhed of Chriſts obedience, into active and paſſive, do ſort them to ſeveral diſtinct purpoſes, dogmatizing thereupon, That Chriſt by his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive obedience, hath freed us from the guilt of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death, and by his active obedience, hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured us a title to eternal life, and That by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſin we have freedom from the one, and by Juſtification by Chriſts Righteouſneſs, we have title to the other. As particularly Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſpeaks, in his Book of <hi>Communion with God.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is much to be deſired, that Chriſtians would <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> (as is the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles prayer for the <hi>Philippians, Ch.</hi> 1.10.) firſt try, and then approve or diſapprove, according to the different nature of things, my purpoſe is in certain Chapters of this Treatiſe, to expoſe to an impartial examination, what that Author hath dictated concerning this matter.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean while, I ſhall offer two things to conſideration:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſays in thoſe ſheets, which he wrote in reference to Mr. <hi>Edw. Fowler</hi>'s Book ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>(The deſign of Chriſtianity.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We believe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>p.</hi> 17. <hi>That Chriſts habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al perfection, with his Active Righteouſneſs, and his ſacrifice, or ſufferings, all ſet together and advanced in value, by their conjunction with his Divine Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, were the true meritorious procuring cauſe of our pardon, juſtification, ſanctification and ſalvation. Not one part imputed to this effect, and another to that, but all thus making up one meritorious cauſe of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:95157:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>all theſe effects, even of the Covenant, and all its benefits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He adds, ſaying (and which is the main truth, which I do by this whole Treatiſe contend for)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thus Chriſts Righteouſneſs is imputed and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to us, not immediately in it ſelf, but in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and fruits: As a ranſom is ſaid to be given to a Captive, becauſe it is given For him, though ſtrictly the ranſom is given to another, and only the fruits of it to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I take to be the Catholick Faith, in the Article before us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be it conſidered, That there is no <hi>Medium</hi> betwixt Life and Death, no middle condition ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally imaginable betwixt theſe two. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we may certainly conclude, That he who by the forgiveneſs of his ſins, is freed from eternal death, cannot otherwiſe but be conceived to have a right to life eternal.</p>
               <p>I proceed to anſwer certain other Arguments, objected from the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>The Apoſtle having ſaid,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 13.38, 39.</note> 
                  <hi>that</hi> through Chriſt was preached to them the forgiveneſs of ſins, <hi>he adds, as a further priviledg or benefit, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> And by him all that believe, are juſtified. <hi>This is objected (if I do not miſ-remember) in the ſaid Book ſtyled</hi> Communion with God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The words being tranſlated out of the original, run thus, <hi>Be it known unto you therefore Men and Brethren, that by this man forgiveneſs of ſins is preached unto you, and from all things, from which you could not be juſtified by the Law of Moſes,</hi> this is the entire <hi>v.</hi> 38. in the Greek, and then it follows <hi>v.</hi> 39. <hi>By him every believing man is juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> The words being thus rendred, and an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:95157:71"/>laid upon <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (which is oft-times in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as much as even) do clearly make the ſame thing to be meant by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is meant by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, do clearly, I ſay, make juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and remiſſion of ſin to be the ſame thing, or of the ſelf ſame adequate importance, that implying no more priviledg or benefit than this.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Read the words as we find them tranſlated, and it is ſufficiently clear, that the words (juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and remiſſion) are but varied phraſes of one and the ſame thing, it being the manner of Scripture, frequently to expreſs the ſelf ſame thing, by varied words and phraſes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſaid Scripture, being alledged uſually for the proving, that juſtification doth denote a further priviledg than forgiveneſs of ſin, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Imputation of Chriſts active obedience, muſt for that purpoſe thus be paraphraſed, <hi>Through this man is preached unto you the forgiveneſs of ſins, and by him all that believe, have Chriſts active obedience imputed to them from all things, from which you could not have Chriſts active obedience imputed to you by the Law of Moſes.</hi> Hereupon let any Reader judg, whether this Scripture makes for the purpoſe, for which it is alledged, whether by Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> or any other of the adverſe Brethren in this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie.</p>
               <p>Some other Objections there are, but they are ſo weak, that no impartial or unprejudicate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will (I am moſt aſſured) be ſwayed by them; and therefore having anſwered the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I ſhall let paſs the reſt.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now propound another Queſtion.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Are not believing ſinners reſtored by Chriſt unto a greater degree of felicity, than</hi> Adam <hi>did loſe, or forfeit by his ſin, and are not Believers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:95157:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>to this greater degree of glory by their juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, through the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs to them, and not upon the meer ſcore of the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their ſins?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In anſwer hereunto, I will ſet down in the firſt place, what the opinion of others is in this matter, and then ſpeak my own ſence.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There be many, who as they judg, that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are reſtored to a greater degree of felicity in this life, than <hi>Adam</hi> did enjoy in Paradiſe, ſo alſo that they ſhall enjoy through the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, a greater degree of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly glory, than <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have enjoyed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his continuance in a ſtate of innocency. But there are others who think, that both of them are juſtly queſtionable, and ſcarce proveable by the Scriptures, eſpecially the latter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There be others, aſſerting, That there is in the merits of Chriſt, not only <hi>Plenitudo ſufficientiae,</hi> but alſo <hi>redundantiae,</hi> or that his ſatisfaction was ſuper-ſatisfactory (not only <hi>Legalis juſtitiae,</hi> but alſo <hi>Super-legalis meriti</hi> (as are the expreſſions of the very learned Dr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> in ſome of his Sermons, if I do not miſ-remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) they, I ſay, thus aſſerting, do yield, that Believers ſhall enjoy through Chriſt, a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of glory in heaven, than they loſt by the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> or in him: But they ſay, That they are entitled unto this overplus of glory, not ſimply by vertue of the remiſſion of their ſins, or juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (for this, ſay they, doth only reſtore them <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtatum quo prius,</hi> to ſuch a degree of happineſs as they loſt in <hi>Adam,</hi>) but by vertue of the ſuper-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed grace of adoption; and of this opinion are thoſe two learned Authors, Mr. <hi>Will. Bradſhaw,</hi> and Mr. <hi>John Goodwin;</hi> and how far forth Mr.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:95157:72"/>
                  <hi>Baxter</hi> is inclinable thereunto, and what his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more fully is, himſelf hath declared in a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Section thereabout, in his Book againſt <hi>Colvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> if my memory do not fail me.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for my own ſence, I conceive;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That as the loſs of Gods fatherly love and favour, and our becoming children of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, was one part of the puniſhment of mans ſin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As thereupon it follows, That our adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or being reſtored into Gods fatherly love and favour, is one prime branch at leaſt of forgiveneſs of ſin: So conſequently,</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Believers are no otherwiſe entitled to that farther degree of glory, by vertue of their Adoption, than by vertue of the remiſſion of their ſins; and I do the rather conceive this to be the truth, becauſe whatever that higher degree of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry here ſuppoſed is, I doubt not, but the loſs or miſs thereof is threatned, for ſins committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Covenant of grace, together with a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er degree of poſitive puniſhment, than was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Adam,</hi> for breach of the Covenant of works. Now foraſmuch as Jeſus Chriſt hath by his ſatisfaction, procured pardon for ſins commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted explicitly againſt the New, as well as the Old Covenant (always excepted to final non-perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the conditions of that New Covenant, which are ſummarily comprehended in Repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt) and foraſmuch as this pardon is promiſed, and vouchſafed to ſinners, upon their repentance and faith in Chriſt, it doth, as I think, neceſſarily follow, That what ſinner ſoever hath his ſins (all his ſins againſt both Covenants) pardoned, that perſon is immediately diſcharged, or freed not
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:95157:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>only from that puniſhment, and loſs of favour, which he did incur, and forfeit in <hi>Adam,</hi> but he is moreover ſet free from that greater degree of puniſhment, which is threatned for ſins commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt the Covenant of grace, and is alſo by his pardon, entitled to that higher degree of glory and happineſs, which is ſuppoſed to be promiſed in the ſame. But that he is entitled thereunto by his juſtification, with ſuch an Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, as is here pretended, I ſee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at all to acknowledg, and therefore I muſt ſtill deny it, till I ſee it proved, adding withal, that as for the ſaid higher degree of heavenly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſuppoſed to be enjoyed by Believers for Chriſts ſake, I think it to be a matter rather of curious, than neceſſary enquiry, wherein we are not to be ſolicitous of being wiſe above what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
               <p>I ſhall cloſe this Chapter with the words of Mr. <hi>Anth. Burges,</hi> the ſaid Author of the Tract con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Juſtification (<hi>firſt part, p.</hi> 143, 144.)</p>

                  <hi>Remiſſion of ſin</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is not only</hi> Ablativa mali, <hi>but alſo</hi> Collativa boni, <hi>it is not a meer ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of-puniſhment due to us, but alſo a plentiful vouchſafing of many gracious favours to us, ſuch as a Son-ſhip, and right to eternal life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe words in his firſt Book concerning Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, when I compare with what he ſays direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and profeſſedly contrary thereunto, in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Book, which came forth ſome years after, which are theſe, <hi>p.</hi> 269.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(Remiſſion of ſin and juſtification differ in this conſideration, In forgiveneſs of ſin there is</hi> Ablatio mali, <hi>in juſtification there is</hi> Collatio boni; <hi>when ſin is forgiven, the eternal evil deſerved is removed, but when we are juſtified, eternal good is promiſed.)</hi>

               <p>I will inſtance in ſome of the prime miſchievous conſequences, of the doctrine here oppoſed, which being cryed up by ſome Authors, as a Goſpel-my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery (a Myſtery of piety) will manifeſt it to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed A <hi>myſtery of iniquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It follows from thence, That Chriſt was made a ſinner, or That by Gods Imputation, and mans Reputation, Jeſus Chriſt was the greateſt ſinner in the world.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> affirms the former, as hath been ſaid, the latter is aſſerted by Dr. <hi>Grew,</hi> in his late print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sermons upon <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.6. (he quoting the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Luther,</hi> for one branch of the aſſertion, touching <hi>Gods</hi> Imputation, and that Scripture in <hi>Mar.</hi> 15.28. touching mans Reputation) as if, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was reputed a tranſgreſſor by the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Jews, therefore it's to be concluded, that he was, or was to be ſo reputed by all others. What Chriſtian ears can bear with the ſound of ſuch a ſaying as this, That by Imputation of God, Jeſus Chriſt was the greateſt ſinner in the world? And how falſe is it to ſay, That God did repute Jeſus
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:95157:75"/>Chriſt to be otherwiſe, whether in life or death, than indeed he was <hi>(i. e.) A Lamb without ſpot and blemiſh, holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> as the Scriptures ſpeak of him? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26.</p>
               <p>The truth is, if any ſuch ſaying hath dropt from the pen of <hi>Luther,</hi> it is not to be juſtified, but to be abhorr'd: For Chriſt by Imputation was no ſinner at all, nor ſo reputed, either by God or man, except ſuch as did not know him, and who therefore hang'd him on the tree.</p>
               <p>As for the ſaid Dr. <hi>Grew,</hi> he ſays indeed (<hi>p.</hi> 23, 24.) That in this ſence only Chriſt was made ſin for us, in that he took on him the obligation to puniſhment: Where let two things be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That the Doctor doth miſtake and miſ-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the true ſenſe of that Scripture, wherein Chriſt is ſaid to have been made ſin for us, the true ſence whereof is (as hath been already ſaid) not that he was made ſin it ſelf, or ſin at all for us, but a ſin-offering, or a ſacrifice for ſin.</item>
                  <item>2. Be it obſerved, That the Doctor doth not ſay, that Chriſt took on him An obligation, but The obligation to puniſhment; by which ſaying, he muſt rationally be underſtood to mean<note n="‖" place="margin">The error whereof I have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter againſt Mr. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſon.</hi>
                     </note> Our obligation to puniſhment, or the ſame obligation, wherein, or whereby we ſinners were bound to puniſhment. And if he had meant otherwiſe, his own reaſon and underſtanding would no more have ſuffered him, to approve that ſaying father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon <hi>Luther,</hi> of Chriſt his being the greateſt ſinner in the world by Imputation, than his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack would have ſerved him to have eaten his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements.</item>

               <p>Another evil Conſequence of the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, in the ſence diſown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>viz.</hi> That Believers are as perfectly Righteous, as is Chriſt The Righteous, yea, that they are more Righteous, than if they had in their own perſons perfectly kept the whole Law, and that they are as acceptable to God the Father, as is Chriſt himſelf. The falſhood and impiety of which ſayings at large manifeſted, and ſome Scriptures which are ſuborned to ſpeak againſt the truth, vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. That man may be ſaid to be juſtified by the Righteouſneſs of another, and not by his own, three wayes, in the Application of which diſtinction it is plainly declared, in what ſence we are, and in what ſence we are not juſtified by the Righteouſneſs of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not by our own.

               <p>The firſt ſhall be Mr. <hi>Will.</hi> Eyre, who in his fore-cited Aſſize-Sermon, ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That upon Chriſt his becoming our Surety, and taking our ſins upon himſelf, ſinners are thereby made as perfectly Righteous, as Chriſt the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor doth he content himſelf only to ſay it, but he doth alſo wreſt that Scripture in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.7. to prove it; I ſay, wreſt that Scripture to prove it; for that Text proves no ſuch thing, but only this, <hi>viz.</hi> That he who doth righteouſneſs, is born of him (as is the expreſſion, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.29.) that is, doth reſemble him, or is like him, as a child re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles the father who begat him. Yea, he doth bleſs that his falſe doctrine with his ſubſequent prayer, therein taking Gods holy Name in vain, by ſaying, <hi>Now the good Lord open all our eyes, to ſee the real and glorious excellency of this Priviledg.</hi> But while he doth thus proclaim the Priviledg of the Saints, have we not cauſe to ſay, That he hath forgotten that Prerogative of our Saviour, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18. it being his right to have the Preheminence in all things? Certainly St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s eyes were not opened to ſee this as his priviledg, when he ſaid to our Saviour, <hi>Depart from me, for I am a ſinful man, O Lord;</hi> for had he owned any ſuch glorious priviledg, or been ſenſible of the excellency thereof, he would in all reaſon have mated his Lord and Maſter (as I may ſo ſay) or have ſet himſelf cheek by chole with him, and have ſaid, Abide by me, keep not at diſtance from me; for I am as perfectly Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as thou art. The ſame Author doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther amplifie and illuſtrate the ſaid priviledg of the Saints, ſaying, <hi>p.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Priviledg is not only negative, but poſitive,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:95157:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>as they are uncloathed and ſtript of their own filthy garments</hi> (Zech. 3.4.) <hi>ſo they are cloathed upon with the immaculate robe of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, adequate and commenſurate to the Law of God;</hi> by the obedience of one (<hi>ſays the Apoſtle,</hi> Rom. 5.19.) many are made righteous <hi>(i. e.) perfectly and compleatly righteous, more than if they had kept the Law in their own perſons; hereby we come to have boldneſs and confidence in the ſight of God, his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite purity and holineſs doth not daunt, or diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage us from going to him; for as Chriſt is before him, ſo are all they that do believe in him, through that Righteouſneſs of his, that is put upon them,</hi> ſee <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2.</p>
               <p>But the meaning of thoſe words (By the obedience of one many are made Righteous) is not as this Author expounds it (perfectly and compleatly Righteous, more than if they had kept the Law in their own perſons) but the meaning is, They are, for the meritoriouſneſs ſake of Chriſts obedience, made Righteous, with another kind of Righteouſneſs, than is that, which doth conſiſt in their perſonal, perfect and compleat performance of the Law of God, yea, with ſuch a kind of Righteouſneſs, as is not competible with it, <hi>viz.</hi> with the pardon of their ſins, or that kind of evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical juſtification, which is ſtyled, The gift of grace, <hi>v.</hi> 15. and the free gift of many offences to juſtification, <hi>v.</hi> 16. and the gift of Righteouſneſs, <hi>v.</hi> 17. For ſinners to be made, or conſtituted Righteous, is in the ſence of the Apoſtle (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the context) to be juſtified, out of the abundance of Gods grace in Chriſt, or to be freely pardoned; which no perſons can be, or be ſaid to be, who are as perfectly and compleatly Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as if they had kept the Law in their own
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:95157:77"/>perſons: For thoſe who are as perfectly and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly righteous, and more righteous, than if they had kept the Law in their own perſons, are not juſtified of grace at all, or are they capable of a gracious pardon.</p>
               <p>And as for the boldneſs and confidence, which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of in <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.12. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2. it is an holy boldneſs and confidence, grounded upon their pardon of ſin and juſtification, through Gods grace in Chriſt (mentioned in the foregoing Paragraph) and not upon any ſuch miſ-conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſacred Scriptures, as this Author was ſo extreamly over-bold and confident to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt.</p>
               <p>And whether Believers may be truly,<note place="margin">As for that in <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.4. the true ſence whereof is here perverted by Mr. <hi>Will.

Rei culpae,</hi> guilty perſons, and as ſuch (however pardoned) they do ſtill ſtand before God, and ſhall ſo ſtand to all eternity. Chriſt is before God the Son of God by nature, and Righteous without a pardon, whereas Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in Chriſt, are before God his ſons by the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of grace, and Righteous by, or with a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pardon, in the blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The next to Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> I will quote, is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Book ſtyled, <hi>The Marrow of Modern Divinity,</hi> who ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 127.</p>

               </list>
               <p>I will cloſe this Chapter with a requeſt, That the foreſaid diſtinction [touching the ſeveral ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, wherein a man may be ſaid to be juſtified by the Righteouſneſs of another, and not by his own] may the rather be obſerved, becauſe it may ſerve for a two-fold purpoſe;</p>
               <p n="1">1. It may be ſubſervient to us, how to give a ready and ſatisfactory anſwer to that paſſage of Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> [with certain others] in his often cited Book, wherein he ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 167.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſt is made of God to the Saints Righteouſneſs, and they will own nothing elſe to that purpoſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer:</p>
               <p n="1">1. For Chriſt to be made of God Righteouſneſs to the Saints, is not for God to impute Chriſts Righteouſneſs immediately in it ſelf to them (as the Doctor would have it, he ſaying to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as in other places, ſo <hi>p.</hi> 110. That that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of obedience, which we have in Chriſt, is imputed to us) but in the ſaving effects of it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>He is of God made unto us Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs, and Sanctification and Redemption (i. e.)</hi> he is cauſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, efficiently, or effectually made all theſe unto us: And one would think, that this Doctor ſhould content himſelf with that ſence of the phraſe [Chriſt his being made of God Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto us] for he ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 104. <hi>That in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant God becomes our God, and we his people, and thereby all his Attributes are ours (i. e.) as to the benefit of them,</hi> as elſe-where he interprets it.</p>
               <p>The Doctor doth not ſay, That upon our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Covenant with God, Gods Attributes are imputed to us, nor doth he barely and ſimply ſay,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:95157:80"/>Gods Attributes are ours; but he explicates that ſaying in theſe words [that is, as to the benefit of them] ſo that there is juſt cauſe to think, that the Doctor of any man ſhould reſt ſatisfied with that explication, which others do give of ſuch phraſes, touching the manner of the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, or its being made ours, they ſaying of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, as he ſays of Gods At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though the Saints will own nothing, as the meritorious cauſe of their righteouſneſs, pardon, or juſtification, but the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, nevertheleſs they may, and ought to own evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical obedience <hi>(i. e.)</hi> their return to God in faith and repentance, as the <hi>condition,</hi> without which the ſaid ſaving effect, or benefit of Chriſts Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, ſhall not be theirs.</p>
               <p>Where (by the way) obſerve the unjuſtifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of thoſe <hi>Antinomian</hi> ſayings of the Doctor, <hi>p.</hi> 118.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Chriſt himſelf is the Righteouſneſs, that he requires at our hands.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 166. <hi>It will one day appear, that God abhors the janglings of men, about the place of their own works and obedience, in the buſineſs of their acceptation with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To theſe ſayings I reply;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Chriſt himſelf is our Righteouſneſs, in ſuch a ſence as he is ſaid to be our Life <hi>(i. e.)</hi> not in a formal, but in a cauſal ſence, the predication in ſuch Propoſitions not being <hi>Formalis,</hi> or <hi>Eſſentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> but <hi>Cauſalis,</hi> as is the manner of Logicians to expreſs ſuch matters.</item>
                  <item>2. As it is not truly ſaid in a literal, but only in a tropical ſence, that Chriſt himſelf is our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, ſo it is not true in any ſence (I know) to ſay, That Chriſt himſelf is the Righteouſneſs,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:95157:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>which he requires at our hands, neither do I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member any ſuch ſaying in Scripture, but rather that Chriſts Righteouſneſs or Obedience,<note place="margin">How many diſputes have been managed, (<hi>ſays Dr.</hi> O. <hi>p. 166, 167.</hi>) how many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions invented, how many ſhifts and evaſions ſtudied, to keep up ſomething in ſome place or other, to ſome pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that men may dally with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al? <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the Doctor will not ſuffer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical obedience to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of place (one or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) in order to our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God.</hi>
                     </note> was a thing required at his hands, and not at ours.</item>
                  <item>3. As Chriſts Righteouſneſs was a thing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at his hands, ſo it is apparent by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that there is a perſonal evangelical Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs required at our hands, in order to our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation with God, by, through, or for the Righteouſneſs ſake of Chriſt, and without which evangelical Righteouſneſs, the unrighteous ſhall not be accepted with God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.20. and 25. <hi>laſt.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9.</item>
                  <item>4. It will one day appear, how God abhors the vain janglings (that I may not ſay alſo the jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings) of men, who not perceiving, or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the conſiſtency, or ſubordination of our own perſonal Righteouſneſs to Chriſts, in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our acceptation with God, would thruſt either of them out of their proper place <hi>(i. e.)</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſts Righteouſneſs out of the place, or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the alone meritorious cauſe, or our own evangelical Righteouſneſs <hi>(i. e.)</hi> our return to God by faith and repentance, from the office or place of a condition of our acceptation. What God ſaid to <hi>Cain</hi> (Gen. 4.7. <hi>If thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted?</hi>) the ſame in effect doth God in his Goſpel ſay to every ſinner, If thou doſt well, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> If thou doſt believe in Chriſt, if thou doſt repent and convert, thou ſhalt be accepted through Chriſt; if otherwiſe, <hi>ſin lies at the door,</hi> and will obſtruct thy acceptation with God.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Again, Obſerve from the premiſſes, the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of that other ſaying of the Doctor, <hi>p.</hi> 219. where having quoted 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. he ſays, <hi>Not that Chriſt is this, or that part of our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:95157:81"/>with God, but he is all, he is the whole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, as the very truth is;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Although Chriſt be the whole, and ſole me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious cauſe of our acceptation with God, yet he is not the whole, nor any the leaſt part of our acceptation it ſelf: For Chriſt being altogether a cauſe extrinſecal to our acceptation with God, he cannot poſſibly be any part of, or ingredient into the thing it ſelf: For this were to make Chriſt to be a cauſe intrinſecal to it, and conſequently either the formal, or material cauſe thereof (for theſe only are <hi>Cauſae,</hi> or <hi>Partes Conſtitutivae,</hi> which do <hi>Ingredi naturam rei</hi>) neither of which he can be ſaid to be, but the meritorious cauſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As was afore ſaid, ſo I ſay again, That in order to our acceptation with God, both Chriſt hath his part, and we have our part to act, both of them being ſeverally and joyntly aſſigned us of God. So that if by the whole of our acceptation with God, the Doctor doth mean, that Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs, is all that God requires, in order to our acceptation with him, his ſaying is to be rejected as falſe, and a branch of <hi>Antinomian</hi> doctrine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I deſire, that the foreſaid diſtinction may the rather be obſerved, becauſe it may ſerve to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the maleyolence, or in-ſincerity, or at leaſt (to ſpeak moſt favourably, and with the utmoſt of charity) the <hi>ignorance</hi> of thoſe, who ſay, That the diſpute here is, Whether we are juſtified before the Juſt and Holy God, by our own righteouſneſs, or by the Righteouſneſs of a Mediator?</p>
               <p>Theſe are the very words of the Author of the late Book ſtyled,<note n="‖" place="margin">In the laſt Page of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to his Book.</note> 
                  <hi>Anti-Sozzo;</hi> who ſhould either have had more wit to know, or more grace to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:95157:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Diſpute between Proteſtant and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant is not, Whether ſinners be juſtified before God, by their own Righteouſneſs, or by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt our Mediator; but whether there be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo an evangelical Righteouſneſs (conſiſting in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to God by faith and repentance) required of every ſinner, in order to his being juſtified, for the ſake of Chriſts Mediatory Righteouſneſs, as the alone meritorious cauſe thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is that, which however ſome Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants do diſpute, and ſeem to gainſay, yet others do not, but do profeſſedly maintain; among whom I ſhall inſtance in the late Aſſembly of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, as appears by the Confeſſion of their Faith and Catechiſm; they profeſſing (<hi>Ch.</hi> 15. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. of their Confeſſion)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That although repentance be not to be reſted in as a ſatisfaction for ſin, or any cauſe of the pardon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which is the act of Gods free grace in Chriſt, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs it is of ſuch neceſſity to all ſinners, that none may expect pardon without it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as appears alſo by the expreſs anſwer, which they do inſtruct every Catechumen to make unto this Queſtion [What doth God require of us, that we may eſcape his wrath and curſe due to us, by reaſon of the tranſgreſſion of the Law?] the anſwer put into their mouths being this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That we may eſcape the wrath and curſe of God due to us, by reaſon of the tranſgreſſion of the Law, he requireth of us repentance towards God, and faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and</hi>—</p>
               <p>I might alſo inſtance in the judgment of our own Church, touching the neceſſity of a perſonal Righteouſneſs in ſinners, that ſo they may be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before God, through the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, or for his ſake abſolved from their ſins.</p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:95157:82"/>
               <p>This appears by the tenor of that diſcharge, or abſolution, which after the general Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Liturgy, every Miniſter is in Gods Name, and as his Commiſſioner, to pronounce, ſaying, <hi>He pardoneth and abſolveth all them that do truly repent, and—wherefore let us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech him to grant us true repentance, and— ſo that at the laſt we may come to his eternal joy, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> I do well remember, that in the <hi>Scotch</hi> Liturgy, after the Petition, <hi>That God would grant us true repentance, and his holy Spirit,</hi> the following words are inſerted <hi>(That we may receive from him abſolution from all our ſins)</hi> which inſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I never heard to have been challenged, by any of our <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Brethren, as holding forth any falſe, Popiſh, or un-Chriſtian doctrine, nor do I know any colour of reaſon for ſuch an accuſation, or ſuſpicion, albeit I do well know, That to pray to God to grant unto us true repentance, and his holy Spirit (That we may receive from him abſolution from all our ſins) is all one in effect, and the ſelf ſame thing, as to pray to God to grant unto us thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, That we may be juſtified, or not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but eſcape wrath to come.</p>
               <p>But foraſmuch as Dr. <hi>O.</hi> is ſuch a profeſſed adverſary, to all manner of ſet-Liturgies, for the carrying on of Gods publick Worſhip (as appears by what he hath written, <hi>p.</hi> 296, 297.) and foraſmuch as I do not know, of what credit with him, an Aſſembly of Divines at St. <hi>Peters-Weſtminſter,</hi> is more than a Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at St. <hi>Pauls-London,</hi> or what conſiderable valuation, he hath for either of them, I will not therefore urge him with the Authority of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:95157:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>either the one, or the other, nor indeed with any other Authority, but what I am moſt aſſured, he will own, and which indeed is all-ſufficient for my purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority of the Holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Having ended this Chapter, I ſhall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſpecifie the next evil Conſequence, of the ſaid Imputation here diſowned, which ſhall be the ſubject of the Chapter next enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

               <p>Another evil Conſequence of the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, in the ſence oppoſed, That God ſees no ſin in the Saints, all their ſins being covered from the ſight of God, by their being clothed with the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; the falſity of which is diſcovered, and certain Scriptures vindicated from their abuſe. A reply to Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> who denies, That it will follow, from the ſaid Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs to us, that we are as perfectly righteous as Chriſt is.</p>

               <p>This ſeems to be an unavoidable Conſequence of the former; for if Believers are as perfectly

               <p>In anſwer hereunto, 1. I have in certain Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of my Exercitation, concerning the nature of forgiveneſs of ſin, ſuggeſted ſeveral Rules, for a due interpretation of thoſe Metaphorical phraſes, whereby forgiveneſs of ſin is expreſſed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſuch as theſe <hi>(Gods covering our ſins, blotting them out, caſting them behind his back, hiding his face from them—)</hi> whereby is not meant a bare intuitive ſight in God, but Gods not ſeeing our ſins, ſo as to condemn us for them, or that the Saints ſhall no more be condemned for their ſins, than if God did not ſee them, than if they were blotted out, covered, or hid from his ſight. See <hi>Ch.</hi> 3. and 4th. and 9th.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for thoſe fore-cited Scriptures, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.27. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.22. they do indeed prove partly what Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers at preſent are, <hi>viz.</hi> That they are in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of reconciliation with God (reconciled,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:95157:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>pardoned, juſtified—) and partly what at laſt they ſhall be, that is, That they ſhall be preſented per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly holy, as a ſpouſe in perfect beauty — But they do not prove, what Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> doth inſinuate, <hi>viz.</hi> That they are now ſo preſented, or that God ſees not the leaſt ſpot of ſin, or iniquity in them.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Do not ſome deny this and the former evil Conſequence, of the ſaid Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes: For ſo indeed Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> in his Book ſtyled, <hi>Communion with God,</hi> would ſeem to do; but with what ſucceſs, may appear by my Reply to that his anſwer, which he makes to an Objection, both which I ſhall recite as I find them, <hi>p.</hi> 187.</p>
               <p>Having aſſerted in the foregoing Pages, that Chriſts active obedience is reckoned, or imputed to Believers (miſ-alledging, and miſ-interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for that purpoſe ſeveral Scriptures, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21.) he objecteth againſt it, and anſwers to it in the words following:</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But if this be ſo, then are we as Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as Chriſt himſelf, being Righteous with his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>But firſt here is a great difference, if it were no more, than that this Righteouſneſs was inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in Chriſt, and properly his own, it is only rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned and imputed to us, or freely beſtowed upon us, and we are made righteous with that, which is not ours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ſecondly the truth is, that Chriſt was not righteous with that Righteouſneſs for himſelf, but for us, ſo that there can be no compariſon; only this we may ſay, We are righteous with his Righteouſneſs, which he wrought for us, and that compleatly.</hi>

               <p>To this Anſwer I reply;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That the difference here mentioned by the Doctor, and ſaid to be Great, is indeed Small: For the difference is rather Modal, than Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, a difference rather <hi>Quoad Modum,</hi> than <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad veritatem rei,</hi> I mean plainly, a difference about the manner, how Chriſts Righteouſneſs was his own, and how it is Ours: For he doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg, that the ſelf ſame individual Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, which Chriſt wrought for us, is Ours, the only difference being in the <hi>Modus,</hi> or manner, how it was His, and how Ours <hi>(i. e.)</hi> His pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, inherently, or originally, Ours improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by Donation, Imputation, or at the ſecond hand.</item>
                  <item>2. As the ſaid difference is comparatively ſmall, ſo it is nothing at all as to the matter in hand, or the purpoſe, for which it is alledged: For not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this Modal difference, if the ſelf ſame individual Righteouſneſs, which Chriſt wrought for us, be truly and ſubſtantially Ours, or in it ſelf imputed to us, it will follow from thence unavoidably (as I think) that we are as righteous with Chriſts Righteouſneſs, as Chriſt himſelf was with it.</item>
                  <item>3. Although it be true, that Chriſt was not righteous with that Righteouſneſs for himſelf, but for us <hi>(i. e.)</hi> for our behoof, and that we might reap the fruit and benefit of it; and although upon ſuch a conſtruction of his Righteouſneſs, its being not for himſelf, but for us, there can be no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon betwixt him and us; nevertheleſs if the Doctor will allow us to ſay (as indeed he doth) that we are righteous with his Righteouſneſs, which he wrought for us, and that compleatly, he muſt allow to others the compariſon aforeſaid,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:95157:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>which they make to themſelves, touching their being as perfectly righteous, as was Chriſt the Righteous, and that God ſees no ſin in them: For how ſhould God ſee ſin in them, who are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly righteous with that Righteouſneſs, which Chriſt wrought for them, more than in Chriſt himſelf?</item>
                  <item>4. Though we forbear the compariſon, yet granting (as the Doctor doth) that we may ſay poſitively, That we are righteous with his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which he wrought for us, and that compleatly, it will from thence neceſſarily follow, that God ſees no ſin in us: For ſuppoſing Chriſts Righteouſneſs to be a compleat Righteouſneſs, (which we cannot ſuppoſe, except we ſuppoſe it to be without the leaſt ſpot of ſin) and ſuppoſing, that we are compleatly righteous, with that his ſpotleſs, ſinleſs Righteouſneſs, how it is poſſible for God to ſee ſin in us, I do not underſtand, or can perceive.</item>

               <p>Another evil Conſequence of the ſaid Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That it leaves no place for remiſſion of ſin, in perſons made ſo compleatly righteous, with Chriſts Righteouſneſs, and that it doth utterly overthrow the true nature of Goſpel-Juſtification, making the juſtification of a ſinner to be quite another thing, and of another kind, than indeed it is. An Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection anſwered.</p>
               <p>ANother evil Conſequence of the ſaid Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſts Righteouſneſs is, That it leaves no place for remiſſion of ſins, in perſons made compleatly righteous with it.</p>
               <p>It is certain, that God forgave Chriſt no ſin: And the reaſon is obvious, becauſe being perfectly righteous, he had no ſin to be forgiven, according to that of St. <hi>John</hi> (1, 3, 5.) <hi>And in him is no ſin.</hi> Now if men be righteous with the ſame ſinleſs Righteouſneſs, wherewith Chriſt was righteous, they have no ſin to be pardoned, no more than <hi>he</hi> had. Whereas Remiſſion of ſin, as it is a ſaving benefit which we all have need of, and the great purchaſe of Chriſts blood, ſo it is that, which Chriſt hath taught Believers daily to pray for, even after and notwithſtanding this Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs unto them (if any ſuch thing were) except we will maintain, that our Saviour Chriſt compoſed that pattern of prayer, only for the uſe of Infidels and Unbelievers.</p>
               <p>Now to ask Gods mercy in the forgiveneſs of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:95157:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>our ſins, and yet to conceive our ſelves to be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, with the ſpotleſs Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and this compleatly, is rather to mock, or diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with God, than ſeriouſly and in good earneſt to worſhip him, whom we pray unto.</p>
               <p>Briefly, The ſaid Imputation doth utterly overthrow the true nature of Goſpel-Juſtification, or the juſtification of a ſinner, which doth conſiſt in the remiſſion of his ſins, as hath been already manifeſted: For a legal or perfect Righteouſneſs, imputed to a perſon in the very formality thereof, doth not juſtifie him by way of forgiveneſs of ſins, but is of it ſelf intrinſecally and eſſentially his juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and is ſuch a kind of juſtification, as with which forgiveneſs of ſins is not competible: For what need hath he, who hath a legal Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs imputed to him, of forgiveneſs of ſins, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ſuch a Righteouſneſs excludes all ſin?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If it be objected, That a mans ſins are firſt forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, and then Chriſts perfect Righteouſneſs is imputed to him, and ſo he is juſtified?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this it hath been already anſwered;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That Chriſts Righteouſneſs is no more, or otherwiſe imputed to a ſinner, in order to his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, than in order to the remiſſion of his ſin.</item>
                  <item>2. That a perſon, who is a ſinner, is capable of no other kind of juſtification, than that, which is by, or doth conſiſt in the remiſſion of his ſins.</item>
                  <item>3. That if a mans ſins be forgiven him, he hath no need of any Imputation, of any further Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs for his juſtification: For when God hath given men their offences (according to that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Apoſtle, <hi>The free gift is of many offences unto juſtification</hi>) that is, hath <hi>forgiven</hi> them, he
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:95157:86"/>hath fully juſtified them. The Apoſtle in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion [the gift of offences] alludes to that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor of debts, under which notion our Saviour ſpeaking of ſin, did teach his Diſciples to pray for the forgiveneſs thereof, to give a debt, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give it, being all one, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.12.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Laſtly, Whereas this Objection ſuppoſeth, that by the paſſive obedience of Chriſt, we have remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſin, and by the Imputation of the active part of his obedience, we are juſtified, as I have already diſproved it, and aſſerted withal, that the whole obedience of Chriſt [God-man] doth make up the meritorious cauſe of all ſaving benefits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on us, ſo I add, If we will needs diſtinguiſh the effects of Chriſts active and paſſive obedience, after that manner, I cannot perceive, that it is any ways reaſonable, to invert the order of theſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and diſpoſe of them thus <hi>Ad placitum,</hi> in a croſs method to their ſeveral cauſes producing them, which ſome Authors preſume to do, and in ſpecial Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> among others. Chriſt did not firſt die, and then keep the Law for us, but he firſt kept the Law, and then ſuffered death for us. Therefore if we will needs make the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the one, a diſtinct benefit from the other, reaſon (methinks) would, that <hi>that</hi> which is firſt purchaſed, ſhould be firſt beſtowed, or received, and conſequently, that Imputation of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhould have a precedency in order, before remiſſion of ſin.</p>

               <p>Another evil Conſequence of the ſaid Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That it ſubverts the neceſſity of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, in order to our ſalvation by Chriſt, that the non-neceſſity thereof in Believers, hath been aſſerted by ſome.</p>
               <p>MR. <hi>Baxter</hi> having charged the opinion here impugned, as many ways ſubverting Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, for proof of that charge, I ſhall ſuggeſt to conſideration, Whether in the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence thereof, it doth not ſubvert the neceſſity of repentance and new obedience, in order to a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſalvation by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>To this end be it conſidered, how the matter is obvious to be argued, <hi>e. g.</hi> If <hi>Adam</hi> had kept the Law, he had needed no repentance more, than Chriſt himſelf needed it: Now, if upon the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs unto us, in its eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential nature, we may be ſaid to have kept the Law in Chriſt, as exactly and perfectly as he did, what need of repentance have we, or can we have, more than the firſt, or the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus? For if the exact and perfect obedience of Chriſt, be the ground and reaſon, why Chriſt himſelf needed no repentance, and this obedience in all the exactneſs and perfection thereof, be as truly Ours by Imputation, as it was his, or as it could have been Ours by perſonal performance, how is it poſſible, that it being a ſufficient ground, of a non-neceſſity of repentance in the one, it ſhould not be the ſame in the other? Yea, if it be
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:95157:87"/>true, what hath been related, as owned by Mr. <hi>Will. Eyre</hi> and Mr. <hi>S. Rols,</hi> viz. That through the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, we are not only as perfectly righteous, but alſo more perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly righteous, than if we our ſelves had fulfilled the whole Law, it muſt follow from thence (in all reaſon I think) that we have leſs need of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, than the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> ever had ſince his creation.</p>
               <p>I have ſomewhere read (the ſtory is told by Mr. <hi>John Godwin</hi>) that a certain Miniſter being preſſed with this Argument, was thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to acknowledg to him, That Believers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfectly righteous, through the ſaid Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, have no need of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p>And the ſelf ſame thing was aſſerted by Dr. <hi>Criſpe,</hi> Rector of <hi>Brinkworth,</hi> near me, as I have heard it related from the mouthes of two ear-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes (Mr. <hi>Tho. Baily,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Minal,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Nicholas Proffet,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Malborough,</hi> both of them Members of the late Aſſembly) and who gave me leave to publiſh it in Print (they profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves ready to atteſt the ſame.)</p>
               <p>The ſtory in ſhort (for it is needleſs here to relate the circumſtances thereof, as to the time when, place where, and company among whom, all which I did ſet down in writing) is this;</p>
               <p>The ſaid Doctor being ſeriouſly, and not <hi>Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationis ergo</hi> (as himſelf proteſted) maintaining the ſaid aſſertion (That Believers have no need to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of their ſins) and being urged by them, with the example of <hi>David</hi>'s repenting, for his horrid crimes of adultery and murder, he anſwered, That <hi>David</hi> did more, than he ought to have done, he being not ſo fully and clearly acquainted with Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Priviledges,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:95157:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>as we now under the New Teſtament are.</p>
               <p>Thus we have heard the miſchievous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, of the ſaid doctrine of Imputation, reſpectively to ſin paſt, and as for the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence thereof, reſpectively to future duty, the next Chapter will diſcover.</p>

               <p>Another evil Conſequence of the ſaid Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That it overthrows the neceſſity of new obedience, in order to a ſinners being ſaved by Chriſt; Whence it is, that divers Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, whereof ſome are named, do aſſert, That Chriſtians are not to do any good duties, that they may be ſaved. Several paſſages to this purpoſe in Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s Book ſtyled, <hi>(Communion with God)</hi> related, with Animadverſions thereupon more at large.</p>
               <p>THat the ſaid opinion overthrows the neceſſity of new obedience, in order to a ſinners ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Chriſt. If God doth impute a perfect, formal Righteouſneſs to men [ſuch as Chriſts was] what need can there be of perſonal holineſs, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to impunity? For in the ſaid caſe of Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it muſt be ſuppoſed, that the rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges belonging to ſuch a Righteouſneſs, do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company it in the Imputation; ſo that the perſon, to whom ſuch Imputation is made, ſtands really
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:95157:88"/>inveſted and poſſeſſed of them: For otherwiſe God gives husks, ſhels, ſhadows, and empty ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, without the ſubſtance of benefit, and true honour.</p>
               <p>Now one main Priviledg of a perfect, formal Righteouſneſs, is to inveſt with a full and entire right to life, even of its own intrinſecal and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent worth.</p>
               <p>Hereupon ſome Preachers do not ſtick to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and teach, that there is nothing neceſſary to be done by ſinners, That they may be ſaved by Chriſt; among whom I have obſerved Mr. <hi>Thomas Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard,</hi> of <hi>New-England,</hi> in his Book ſtyled, <hi>The Sincere Convert,</hi> to be a prime one, he ſaying, <hi>That ſinners are not to do good duties (to repent and reform their ſinful ways) that they may be ſaved. but for other ends, and That the doing of good duties, that they may be ſaved, is the way to be damned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſome years ago, I heard a certain Miniſter, (eminent in the repute of the Vulgar, for one of the moſt able and evangelical Preachers in the whole County where he lived) who preaching concerning thoſe words of the Pſalmiſt (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 98.1.) and from thence having raiſed this doctrine, which was the ſubject of his whole Sermon, <hi>viz. That Jeſus Chriſt hath done marvellous things, and got him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the victory;</hi> he did in the Application thereof, inform his Auditors in the firſt place, That there is nothing for the Saints to do (meaning, as he did interpret himſelf) <hi>that the Saints have nothing at all to do for their ſalvation:</hi> And he did blame people for thinking, That doing is the way to heaven, he only acknowledging, that we muſt do good duties, in the way of love and thankfulneſs to Chriſt, who hath done all for us, and hath got
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:95157:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>himſelf the victory. But if it had been objected to this perſon, That we muſt not only fight, but through Gods help alſo in our own perſons, get the victory, if we think to be crowned (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.7.) and if it had been further on the other hand objected, What need is there of the principles of Love and Gratitude in the Saints, ſeeing according to the doctrine of the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, here impugned, Love it ſelf, and Gratitude it ſelf, even the ſelf ſame Love and Gratitude, which was in the Son of God himſelf, as well as other his graces, or gracious actings, are reckoned to them, and are theirs by Imputation, in the very letter, formality, or eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential nature thereof. If, I ſay, ſuch Objections had been put to the ſaid Preacher, would they not have put him to a ſtand, think we?</p>
               <p>And whether Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> be not of the ſame mind, with the two fore-named Authors in this point, <hi>viz.</hi> That we are not to do good duties for this end, that we may be ſaved, I ſhall leave the judgment thereof to the Reader, by the following paſſage, which I ſhall immediately recite, and then animadvert upon.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Doctor in ſaying, That Chriſt yielded perfect obedience to the Law, ſeems to mean, That he did perfectly obey every Law of God, which we in our own perſons ſhould have obeyed; and I preſume, that he would be underſtood to mean thus, for he ſays often and expreſly, <hi>p.</hi> 179. That <hi>whatſoever was required of us by vertue of any Law, that Chriſt did, and fulfill'd.</hi> And if this be his meaning (as it ſeems plainly to be) I muſt crave leave to gainſay, ſaying, That God did not require of Chriſt to do, and fulfil whatſoever was required of us, by vertue of any Law. There are things required of us, by vertue of divine Laws peculiar to us, and the doing whereof is inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the perſon of Chriſt, and office of his Mediatorſhip, and he did plainly refuſe, when he was upon earth, to do ſome things, which ſome of us are by the Law of God obliged to do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was under no ſuch Law for the doing of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Doctor in ſaying [That Chriſt yielded perfect obedience to the Law, as it ſtood in that conditional, <hi>Do this, and live</hi>] doth ſeem to mean, That the Law, to which Chriſt yielded perfect obedience, was the Law and Covenant of works, made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and that as ſuch he yielded obedience thereunto, whereas the Law to which Chriſt yielded perfect obedience, was the Law of Mediatorſhip, and a Law in that reſpect
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:95157:89"/>peculiar to himſelf, there being but <hi>one Mediator betwixt God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Whereas the Doctor ſays, That Chriſt yielded perfect obedience to the Law, as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, as a means of life, to procure life by it, as the tenor of a Covenant, I conceive no ſuch thing to be true, but that the truth is, That Jeſus Chriſt did yield perfect obedience to the Law of Mediatorſhip, or that (to ſpeak in his own words) <hi>he did finiſh the work, which God gave him to do,</hi> as Mediator, whereby to purchaſe life for us, according to the tenor of another Law or Covenant <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the New Teſtament in his blood.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Although Chriſt hath freed us from obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Law of <hi>works,</hi> as a Covenant of life, and from obeying it for this end, that we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain life everlaſting, according to the tenor of that Covenant, nevertheleſs he hath not freed us from obeying the Law, or Covenant of <hi>grace</hi> for this end, that we may in ſo doing obtain everlaſting life. It is not vain (as the Doctor cenſures) that ſome ſay, confidently, but it is the very truth of Scripture, which all ſhould ſay with the moſt aſſured confidence, <hi>That we muſt work, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of grace we may have life?</hi> For <hi>Seek good and not evil, that ye may live,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 22.12.</note> ſays the Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi> ch. 5.14. <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his Commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life</hi> (i. e.) life everlaſting.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Doctor's charge is notoriouſly falſe and groundleſs to ſay, That to work for life, is all one as to ſay, We are under the old Covenant, <hi>Fac hoc, &amp; vives.</hi> Is it all one to ſay, Do this <hi>(i. e.)</hi> perform perfect and perpetual obedience, that thou maiſt live, as to ſay, with St. <hi>Peter, Repent
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:95157:90"/>and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out?</hi> Or to ſay with the Prophets <hi>Eſay</hi> and <hi>Jeremy, Let the wicked forſake his may, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and return to the Lord</hi>—Eſay 55.7, 8. And <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Waſh thine heart from wickedneſs, that thou maiſt be ſaved?</hi> Or to ſay with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>So run, that ye may obtain? obtain what?</hi> what leſs, than life everlaſting, as appears by the Verſe following, wherein he interprets himſelf? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.24, 25.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Walking is in truth working; our Chriſtian walking is our Chriſtian working, yea I will ſay, it is our Chriſtian warring, fighting, running, wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, doing like the <hi>Olympian Athletae,</hi> even all that belongs to the Champions of Chriſt, God, Angels and Men being ſpectators. All theſe are comprized under the Metaphorical and Scriptural phraſe of Walking with God.</p>
               <p n="7">7. As our obedience is a way of walking with God, ſo it is a way of working to come to him, nor are we more freed from obedience (evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal obedience) as a way of working to come to God, than we are freed from it, as a way of walking with God.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Evangelical working or obedience, as it is the way of walking with God, ſo it is <hi>eo nomine,</hi> the way of coming to God, or that will (through the mercy of God in Chriſt) bring us to God; and as the means muſt be uſed, that by the uſe thereof we may obtain the end, ſo are we [as well in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as in conſcience] to betake our ſelves to the way of walking with God, that therein, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, we may be brought, or come to God.</p>
               <p>I proceed to the examination of certain other paſſages to the ſame purpoſe, in the Doctor's fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Book, wherein he ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 244.</p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:95157:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>There being an impoſſibility of obtaining life by the Law, we are exempted from it as to any ſuch end, and that by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3.21, 22, 23.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, By the <hi>Law</hi> in that Scripture is meant the Moſaical Law, by the perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence whereof, there was indeed an impoſſibility, for any perſons of obtaining life, or juſtification un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life: But this doth not prove, that there is any impoſſibility of obtaining life by the Law of the Goſpel, or that we are exempted from it as to any ſuch end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is the promiſe of God in Chriſt firſt made to <hi>Adam,</hi> Gen. 3.15. and afterwards renewed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and which promiſe is ſpecified, <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17. by which ſinners are exempted from abſolutely perfect obedience to any Law of God, to this end that they thereby may have life.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Although by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt,<note place="margin">What the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or of Works could not do, the Law of the Goſpel (through the mercy of God in Chriſt) can do, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the condition thereof being kept, it can ſave ſinners.</note> (included in that promiſe) ſinners were exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the ſaid perfect obedience to any Law, to this end that they may have life, nevertheleſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are not upon any account whatſoever, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from ſincere obedience, to this end that they may have life, according to the tenor of the Goſpel-promiſe, wherein life is promiſed to thoſe, and only thoſe, who perform the condition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>The Doctor proceeds to ſay in the following Page 245.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There be</hi> Gibeonites, <hi>outwardly attending the family of God, that do the ſervice of his houſe, as the drudgery of their lives, the principle they yield obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience upon, is a Spirit of bondage unto fear,</hi> Rom. 8.15. <hi>the rule they do it by, is the Law in its dread and rigour, exacting it of them to the utmoſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:95157:91"/>mercy and mitigation, the end they do it for, is to fly from the wrath to come, to pacifie conſcience, and ſeek righteouſneſs, as it were by the works of the Law.— The Saints obedience is a free obedience, without fear, terror, bondage and conſtraint, they go forth unto all holy obedience in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. What opinion the Doctor hath of the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> literally or properly ſo called, I know not; but certain I am, that he had no cauſe to uſe their name as here he doth, in the way of reproach and diſgrace, either becauſe they were <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> or becauſe they did the meaner ſort of ſervices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Tabernacle, one of the meaneſt whereof holy <hi>David</hi> did value at a high rate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is againſt reaſon to ſay, that there are, or ever were any ſuch <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> in that full chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, whereby they are here deſcribed by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor: For if ſinners apprehend no other rule of their actings, than the Law in its dread and rigor, exacting of them to the uttermoſt, without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and mitigation, it is more rational to conceive, that they ſhould lye down in utter deſpair, than to drudge or trudge to no purpoſe. Otherwiſe I cannot perceive the ſence of the Pſalmiſt's reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he ſaying, <hi>There is mercy with thee; therefore ſhalt thou be feared,</hi> Pſal. 130.4.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They are not <hi>Gibeonites</hi> neceſſarily (in the Doctor's diſgraceful ſence) but they may be true <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who do Gods ſervice, that they may eſcape wrath to come, and enjoy peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence here; nor is any Chriſtian the leſs an <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite,</hi> or in truth the leſs a <hi>Nathaneel,</hi> becauſe he ſerves God upon account of the reward promiſed thereunto, <hi>it having the promiſes both of the life that now is, and of that which is to come,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.8.</p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:95157:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="4">4. The Doctor doth ill to jumble things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as ſynonimous and homogeneous, which are exceeding diſparate (I mean, the doing Gods ſervice as the drudgery of our lives, and the doing thereof for this end, to fly from the wrath to come) nor indeed are theſe two things conſiſtent: For thoſe, who do regard Gods ſervice as the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red way, or means of eſcaping wrath to come, and do accordingly ſerve God for that end, cannot in reaſon poſſibly be conceived to look upon, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count Gods ſervice as the drudgery, but rather as the felicity of their lives, and in ſuch ſort as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did account of all his, both active and paſſive ſervice of God in Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> no way comparable to the reward of eſcaping hell, and obtaining hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is the Doctors error to inſinuate, that they who ſerve God for this end to fly wrath to come, do ſerve him upon the principle of that ſpirit of bondage intended by the Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. Yea by his inſinuating the ſaid Principle to be ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh, baſe, or unlawful, he doth as much as in him lies, bring the ſouls of men under a ſpirit of bondage, cauſing them to doubt of their being ſervants of God, yea to accuſe themſelves as none of his ſervants, becauſe they ſerve him for this end, <hi>to fly from wrath to come;</hi> and alſo provoking them to ſuch a manner of doing things, as being not required by God in his word, is not part of true Religion, but meer ſuperſtition, yea ſuch things as are impoſſible in nature, as if we ſhould perſwade men to put off humanity, or not to be men. So that I may well ſay to thoſe Readers, or Hearers of the Doctor, who can ſwallow, applaud, or approve ſuch ſayings as theſe in his Book, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of the ſeduced Corinths, perverted by
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:95157:92"/>their falſe Teachers, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20. <hi>ye ſuffer if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you;</hi> I may truly ſay, That the yoke, which the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor would here put upon the neck of Chriſts Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, is heavier than the yoke of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and ſuch as neither we, nor our Fathers, nor ſucceſſors, were, are, or ever ſhall be able to bear.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The obedience of the Saints may be a free obedience, although they do not go forth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto altogether without fear, and terror; and it's very ill done of this Author to inſinuate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. <hi>Noah</hi> went forth with fear to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God in building the Ark, which he did at Gods command, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (ſays the Text) to or for the ſaving of himſelf and family, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7. And it is not to be doubted, but that fear (among other conſiderations) did make <hi>David</hi> to run the way of Gods Commandments, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.32. for what conſtruction otherwiſe can be made of his ſaying in the ſame Pſalm v. 120. <hi>My fleſh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy judgments?</hi> And ſo it did holy <hi>Job,</hi> as appears <hi>Job</hi> 31.23.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Judge Reader, whether it be not a great fault in the Doctor, ſo to miſapply that Scripture <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.32. and to pervert the ſenſe thereof, as to make a Chriſtians ſerving of God to fly from wrath to come, to be a ſeeking for righteouſneſs as it were by works of the Law: for to ſeek righteouſneſs by works of the Law, is to ſeek juſtification or ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the external obſervances of the Judaical Law, and conſequently in a wrong way (oppoſite to the true Goſpel-way of ſerving God) and not by faith in Chriſt, as the Apoſtle doth plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the matter in the ſelf ſame verſe. How unreaſonably therefore doth the Doctor here inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:95157:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>That thoſe Chriſtians, who ſeek righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs by faith in Chriſt (the right Goſpel-way) that is, do ſerve God and live Chriſtian lives, that they may be juſtified for the righteouſneſs ſake of Chriſt, or be ſaved from wrath to come through his merits, that thoſe, I ſay, who do ſerve God like Chriſtians to that end, do take ſuch a fatal courſe, as thoſe Jews did, of whom the Apoſtle there ſpeaks, ſaying, That Jeſus Chriſt was a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block to them, That they fell ſhort of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the end, they aimed at (righteouſneſs, juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſalvation) becauſe they ſought this ſaving happineſs in a wrong way, and not by due means, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> not by faith in Chriſt, or works of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, but by external legal works, as inconſiſtent with the faith of Chriſt incarnate, as is Judaiſm and Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Foraſmuch as the Doctor doth in expreſs words aſſert p. 213. <hi>That God hath appointed, that holineſs ſhall be the means, the way to that eternal life, which as in it ſelf and originally is his gift by Jeſus Chriſt, ſo with regard to his conſtitution of our obedience as the means of attaining it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor ſays well and truly, that well-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the way to heaven, but that other Preacher ſays no, it is not.</note> 
                  <hi>is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>— And again Ib. <hi>That it is the way ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God for us to walk in, for the obtaining of ſalvation.</hi> Theſe aſſertions of the Doctor, I ſay, being conſidered, I muſt needs ſay theſe two things:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I am not able to reconcile the Doctor with that foreſaid Preacher, who in his Sermon upon <hi>Pſal.</hi> 98.1. did reprove people for thinking, That well-doing was the way to heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Nor am I able to reconcile the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor with himſelf in his acknowledging holineſs to be Gods appointed way and means for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of eternal happineſs, and yet making it the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:95157:93"/>part and property of a Gibeonite <hi>(i.e.)</hi> a thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable, a ſlaviſh, or diſgraceful thing in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to ſerve God to fly from wrath to come; for what is it to fly, or eſcape from wrath to come, but to obtain ſalvation? And what therefore is it to ſerve or obey God to fly from wrath to come, but to ſerve God to obtain ſalvation? and why ſhould we not take the way, or uſe the means to obtain the end? or why did God conſtitute ſuch and ſuch things as means for ſuch and ſuch ends, but that, as by him they were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo by us they ſhould be uſed to attain the ſame?</p>
               <p>But for all this the Doctor doth ſo ſpite at the Gibeonites, who are contented to do the meaneſt ſervices, which God puts them to, that ſo they may eſcape the wrath of God in their own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences here, and in the ſlames of Hell hereafter. I ſay, he doth ſo deteſt the whole race of the ſaid Gibeonites, as to fling another ſtone at them in a few pages after, whoſe words I ſhall recite, as I find them pag. 248. and with a few Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions thereupon I will conclude this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Saints motive to obedience is love— The rule of their obedience (their walking with God) is the Law of liberty, as diveſted of all its terrifying, threatning, damning, curſing power, and rendred in the blood of Chriſt Jeſus, ſweet, tender, uſeful, directing, helpful as a rule of walking in the life they have received, not the way of working for the life they have not. Theſe inſtances may ſuffice to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that liberty of obedience in the family of God, which his ſons and daughters have, that the poor convinced Gibeonites are not acquainted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:95157:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. As hope and fear are well conſiſtent with love, ſo are thoſe as well as this the motive of the Saints obedience; and ſo they ought to be, as in part hath been already proved, as to fear in <hi>Noah, Job</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and as is eaſily proveable, even by the current of the Scriptures both of the Old and New Teſtament. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1, &amp; 12, 28, 29. Rom. 11.20. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. And as for hope, its being a principle or motive of the Saints obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 26.7. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13, 14, 15. To multiply Scriptures for the proof of this, which is ſo evident in <hi>nature,</hi> is as needleſs as to light a candle at noon day. As he that ploweth, is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to do it with hope of a crop, every other labourer with hope of ſome gain, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.10. ſo are the Saints moved, and to be moved with the hope of the Goſpel to be ſtedfaſt to it, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable from ſuch a converſation as doth become it.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.58.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not the Law of God as <hi>diverſed of all its terrifying, threatning, damning, curſing power,</hi> which is the rule of the Saints obedience. Such doctrine is a branch of what Dr. <hi>More</hi> ſtiles that loathſome and peſtilential error of <hi>Antinomianiſm;</hi> and indeed it is a root, which (of it ſelf) beareth gall and wormwood, and therefore by all due means to be eradicated out of Gods husbandry, (the hearts and minds of his people) where the Devil (that envious one) hath planted it. And for the extirpation thereof, or confutation of this dangerous piece of <hi>Antinomianiſm,</hi> what need I ſay more, than to deſire the Reader to open his Bible and to read the tenour of the Laws of God given by him as the rule of every ones living (I mean both as the directing and obliging rule) and then to ſpeak his mind, whether the Law of God
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:95157:94"/>(the rule of the Saints obedience) hath not the uſual Sanction of Laws <hi>(i.e.)</hi> a commination of terror, even the terrible curſe of damnation, upon ſuppoſition of their diſobedience thereunto. Doth not God command the Saints to beware of Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and to perſevere in faith and holineſs upon pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril of damnation, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1, &amp; 10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is the Doctors error (as of many others) to think, that the Law of God cannot be ſweet, tender, uſeful, directing, helpful to the Saints as a rule of walking with God, except it be diveſted of its ſanction, as aforeſaid: for although its ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction be ſuppoſed, will not the Saints ſay, as did <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> in another caſe, <hi>Good is the word of the Lord, which he hath ſpoken? Eſa.</hi> 39.8. Yea, are not the very comminations of God uſeful and helpful (even of their own nature and proper tendency) to the Saints in their walking with God, as well as his precepts, or directions? He that denys this, which is ſo proveable, both by Scripture and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is worthy to be taught as <hi>Gideon</hi> taught the men of <hi>Succoth,</hi> with briars and thorns of the wilderneſs, I mean, to be confuted with ſtripes, rather than with words or arguments.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It ſeems, this Doctor hath not ſufficiently ſtudied the reaſon, why Gods Law (the Law of the Goſpel) is ſtyled <hi>a Law of Liberty:</hi> for if he had, he might have known, that it is ſo ſtyled for <hi>this</hi> reaſon (among ſeveral others) becauſe it impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth no ſervile yoaks like thoſe laid upon the Jews, and enjoineth only ſuch ſervices as are ſuited and moſt agreeable to our rational nature, and in the performance of which conſiſteth our trueſt freedom and liberty.</p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:95157:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="5">5. It is another branch of <hi>Antinomian</hi> doctrine to ſay, <hi>That the Law of God is a rule of the Saints walking, in the life they have received, not the way of working, for the life they have not.</hi> This is an error, which as it hath been abundantly confuted by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> in ſeveral of his Writings, ſo I have already refuted in this Chapter, and more at large in the 28th. Chapter of my Exercitation, concerning the nature of Forgiveneſs of ſin, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is manifeſted the conſiſtency of theſe two (work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing From and For life) and that the Saints, from the life of grace they have received, do work and ought to work For the life of glory, which as yet they have not received.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, While the Doctor pretends to maintain that liberty of obedience, in the family of God, which (as he ſays) the ſons and daughters of God have, he makes them worſe ſlaves, than the <hi>Gibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onites</hi> were ever made by <hi>Joſhua.</hi> Now alas for the poor convinced <hi>Gibeonites!</hi> theſe poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced unconvinced <hi>Gibeonites!</hi> convinced in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that it is their duty to ſerve God, but not convinced, that it is their ſin to ſerve Him to this end, to fly from wrath preſent in a wounded conſcience, or from wrath to come, in the lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone! Convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that it is their duty to love God, but not convinced, that the love of God, and the love of their own ſouls, are things inconſiſtent! Convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that a main motive of their ſerving God, ſhould be their love of Him, but not convinced, that love to their ſouls-ſafety and ſalvation, ſhould be no motive at all unto, or end of their ſerving of God! I will ſay to theſe poor <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> who cannot ſo eaſily put off humanity, or be perſwaded out of all love to themſelves, ſpecially to their
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:95157:95"/>ſouls, Let it be a very ſmall thing with you, to be judged of this miſtaken Doctor, yea to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by mans judgment; for he that will judg you at the laſt is the Lord, who will judg your preſent Judges, who paſs ſuch an harſh judgment upon you. But be of good chear: For if to be moved to ſerve God for this end, to fly from wrath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and to come, be to be made indeed a <hi>Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,</hi> then for your comfort be it known to you, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was a <hi>Gibeonite;</hi> for he was induced to preach the Goſpel, upon conſideration of that Woe, that did hang over his head, if he did not preach it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.16. And he did mortifie the deeds of the fleſh, leſt himſelf having preached to others, ſhould at laſt prove to be a caſt-away, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. Yea he profeſſeth for others as well as himſelf, that the end of all his and their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſtrivings, was to obtain for themſelves an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible Crown, <hi>v.</hi> 25. Briefly, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid to ſcoffing <hi>Micol (I will yet be more vile)</hi> ſo let us reſolutely anſwer to the iterated ſcoff of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, If to do as aforeſaid be indeed to be a <hi>Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,</hi> In the Name of God let there be more <hi>Gibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onites,</hi> Let them be fruitful and multiply, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh the Church.</p>
               <p>There are many other dangerous evils, which do naturally flow from the Imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſs, in the ſenſe here oppoſed; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have enlarged my ſelf in the premiſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yound my firſt intention, I will not ſo much as mention them. I will only conclude this long Chapter with the words of Mr. <hi>Truman</hi> in his Book ſtyled (<hi>The great Propitiation,</hi> p. 94, 95.) wherein he ſuggeſteth that miſchievous conſequence of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Chriſts righteouſneſs, which hath in
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:95157:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>this Chapter been ſpecified and inſiſted upon; and I do the rather think meet to tranſcribe the words of that Author, becauſe ſome Readers may perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture regard them as proceeding from his Pen, rather than mine; for notwithſtanding every way, whether by means of one Author or another, (my labour of love in this Treatiſe, or the labours of any other in theirs) ſo the truths of the Goſpel be entertained, I deſire to be affected as was the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, ſaying in another caſe, <hi>I therein do rejoice, yea and will rejoice, Phil.</hi> 1.18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If Chriſt</hi> (ſays that Author) <hi>fulfilled the Law for us in this ſence, ſo as it is to be imputed to us, as if we had fulfil'd the Law our ſelves, then we ſhould be freed altogether from any obligation from the Law to obedience, juſt as we are freed from the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law, becauſe Chriſt underwent it as a ſatisfaction for us, we ſhould not then ſin in not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Law, and we could not be pardoned by Chriſt for our ſins in not obeying the Law; for they are no ſins according to this Hypotheſis. If there be a Law, that if a ſervant hired for a year, ſhall refuſe to ſerve his years ſervice (if his Maſter require) he ſhall lye in the priſon for a year. Suppoſe one hired did not ſerve a year, but another ſerved a year good and faithful ſervice for him, muſt this hired man alſo ſerve a year for himſelf, or he is too blame? and muſt this man accepted to ſerve a year for him alſo, lie in priſon for him? What if I did not ſerve a year, yet another ſerved for me, and better ſervice than I can perform? What need is there may he ſay, that I ſhould ſerve it my ſelf? Do I think, I can mend his work, do it better my ſelf, than I have done it in him? I am almoſt aſhamed to lay open the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them that hold theſe things, after ſuch mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:95157:96"/>of learned proteſtants have ſhewn their abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other two Arguments of this Author in the ſame and the precedent page, are for the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of them well worthy to be here tranſcribed; but I ſhall refer the Reader to the peruſal thereof in his Book it ſelf.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> May Believers be truly or fitly ſaid to be clothed with the Robe of Chriſts Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or the like form of words? Four Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why the ſaid Queſtion is propoſed and anſwered. The Anſwer it ſelf. <hi>1.</hi> That there are no ſuch expreſs ſayings in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor any Scripture, wherein Chriſts Righteouſneſs is ſet forth under the Metaphor of Rayment. <hi>2.</hi> That our own perſonal Righteouſneſs in the ſeveral branches there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, doth go under the Metaphorical expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Robes, comely rayment, and ſplendid array. Several Scriptures, objected to the contrary, anſwered. In what ſence 'tis true, and in what, falſe, to ſay, that we are clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the Robe of Chriſts Righteouſneſs: And that it is more fitly and intelligibly ſaid, that it purchaſeth or procureth Clothing for us, than that it is it ſelf our Clothing.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>MAY Believers be truly, or fitly ſaid to be clothed with the Robe of Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs? To have Chriſts Righteouſneſs put upon them? That their perſons, or ſins are covered with the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, or the like expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have thought meet to propoſe, and make anſwer to this Queſtion, for three or four Reaſons;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Becauſe ſuch expreſſions have been very
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:95157:97"/>uſual in the Sermons and Books of ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.</item>
                  <item>2. Becauſe the miſ-underſtanding of the true ſence, wherein Chriſts Righteouſneſs is imputed to us, and the aſſerting of a ſence contrary to truth, hath been (I doubt not) the ſole cauſe, or occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch expreſſions, one un-ſcriptural phraſe frequently begetting another, and the daughter doth ſometimes happen to be more deformed, than the mother.</item>
                  <item>3. Becauſe ſuch expreſſions have occaſioned ſtrange and groſs conceptions in the minds of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people, as if by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt put upon them, by Gods Imputation, all their ſins were ſo covered and hidden from the ſight of God, as that the eye of divine juſtice ſees not the leaſt ſpot of ſin in thoſe, who are cloathed with it. Such ſayings as theſe have been already recited out of certain Writers.</item>
                  <item>4. Becauſe ſeveral Scriptures have been very frequently perverted, to contenance or authorize ſuch expreſſions, which I will therefore take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to vindicate, whereby to reſtore them to their true ſence and meaning.</item>
               </list>
               <p>I ſhall therefore return a more copious Anſwer to the ſaid Queſtion, and ſay;</p>
               <p n="1">1. I do not remember any place in all the Bible, where the ſaid expreſſions are uſed, or where Chriſts Righteouſneſs is mentioned under the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor of a Robe, or Garment, which Believers are to put on, or wherewith they are, or are to be clothed. I do indeed well remember the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where Chriſt is ſet forth [his fleſh and blood] under the Metaphor of food [meat and drink] but no place, where his Righteouſneſs is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the notion, or Metaphor of <hi>Rayment.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:95157:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="2">2. But on the other ſide, I find many places of Scripture, where our own perſonal righteouſneſs, (even in the ſeveral branches thereof) doth go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſaid Metaphorical expreſſions; for which ſee <hi>Job</hi> 29.14. <hi>I put on righteouſneſs, and it clothed me. My judgment was as a robe and a diadem.</hi> What righteouſneſs doth <hi>Job</hi> there mean? ſurely not Chriſts Righteouſneſs, but his own (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears both by the precedent and ſubſequent verſes, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17.—) <hi>viz.</hi> Juſtice, pity, mercy, and the like vertues. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Put on as the elect of God bowels of mercies, kindneſs</hi>—Eph. 4.22, 23. <hi>Put off concerning the former converſation the old man</hi>—and <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>Put on that new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſs and true holineſs.</hi> 1 Pet. 5.5. <hi>Be ye clothed with humility.</hi> Our own righteouſneſs in the ſeveral branches thereof is that, which in many Scriptures is commended to us under the notion of ſplendid rayment, which adorns us, makes us lovely in the eyes of God, and which is in <hi>his ſight of great price,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.3, 5. 1 Tim. 2.9, 10. To this purpoſe I might inſtance in many ſayings: out of the <hi>Proverbs of Solomon,</hi> were it needful.</p>
               <p>But foraſmuch as ſeveral Scriptures are objected to the contrary, of what hath been here ſaid in the firſt branch of my Anſwer, I will therefore ſpecifie ſome of the chief of them, and reply thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.18. <hi>What elſe is meant by the white rayment there mentioned, but the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Jeſus Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Queſtion may as well be demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, What is meant by the Gold there ſpoken of, but the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt? For we are not otherwiſe clothed with the robe or rayment, than
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:95157:98"/>we are enriched with the gold of Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By the white rayment, is there meant our own righteouſneſs, conſiſting of ſuch gracious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and works of holineſs, which do adorn the Diſciples of Chriſt in his ſight, more than the moſt Lilly-white, and ſplendid rayment, doth the greateſt Princes in the eye of men. And this I conceive to be meant by that rayment of needle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, wherein the Bride (the Lambs wife) is ſaid to be brought unto him, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 45.13, 14. And this is that righteouſneſs of the Saints, wherewith they are ſaid to be<note n="‖" place="margin">Rev. 19.8.</note> arrayed, as in fine linnen, clean and white; righteous works being that ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherewith every Chriſtian (man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) ſhould be clothed, or adorned, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.10.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14. <hi>Are not Chriſtians there commanded to put on the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Whatever be the thing, which the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Romans</hi> are there commanded to put on, I am perſwaded, that the Apoſtles meaning there is, That we ſhould put it on not as a garment, but rather as Armour, we being as well ſaid to put on this, as that. He proſecutes that Metaphor men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>v.</hi> 12. [Put on the Armour of light.]</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſequently I think, that we have no more reaſon to conclude, that by the garment, which we are there commanded to put on, is meant Chriſts Righteouſneſs, than that his Righteouſneſs is it, which under the Metaphor of the Armour of light, we are commanded to put on in the verſe next before. But I am content, that the Reader judg of them.</p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:95157:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="3">3. I know no ſurer way rightly to underſtand, what the Apoſtles true meaning was [That we ſhould put on] than by conſidering what we ſhould put off. Now foraſmuch as the things, which he would have us put off, are what he ſtiles the works of darkneſs <hi>(i. e.)</hi> wicked works of all ſorts, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch as are there named, I may therefore ſafely (I doubt not) conclude, That by our put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he means our put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the graces, or vertues of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, theſe being the image of our Lord Chriſt; and it being ordinary to call the image of a thing, or perſon, by the name of the perſon or thing, which it doth reſemble. And in this ſence the word [Chriſt] is uſed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. <hi>My little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, of whom I travel in birth again, till Chriſt be formed in you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. <hi>Doth not the Apoſtle there mean, that the</hi> Galatians <hi>having been baptized into Chriſt, had put on the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> By Chriſt there is not meant the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt; and what is the very thing there meant by the Apoſtle, that the baptized <hi>Galatians</hi> had put on, I know no ſurer way to underſtand, than by conſidering the ſcope of the Apoſtle in that Epiſtle, what it was, that he would have them to put off. Now that, which the Apoſtle in this Epiſtle eſpecially would have the <hi>Galatians</hi> to put off, was Judaiſm, in all the parts of it as ſuch. So that as by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14. is meant Chriſtianity, in oppoſition to Gentiliſm, or thoſe heatheniſh vices there ſpecified, ſo by Chriſt in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. I conceive is meant Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or the practice of Chriſtian Religion, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to Judaiſm. <hi>As many of you as have been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:95157:99"/>into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt,</hi> not <hi>Moſes,</hi> you have taken upon you the profeſſion of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, not that of the Jewiſh, or Moſaical Law.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Is not Chriſts Righteouſneſs the thing it ſelf meant by</hi> the wedding garment? <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, but thoſe holy qualifications, and gracious diſpoſitions, wherewith a Chriſtian ſhould attend upon God in his ſacred Ordinances, and in his ſolemn approaches to God, ſhould be veſted with, even as men upon feſtival occaſions, do apparrel themſelves in rayment ſuitable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Is not the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt that</hi> garment of ſalvation, <hi>and</hi> robe of righteouſneſs, <hi>wherewith God is ſaid</hi> Eſa. 61.10. <hi>to have</hi> clothed, or covered his Church?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It were eaſie to name many Authors, who have perverted that Scripture to ſuch a ſence; whereas the truth is, that there is no more cauſe to think, that the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is meant by the garment there mentioned, than where men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of the ſame word by the Prophet elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where (<hi>Ch.</hi> 52.1.) ſaying, <hi>Awake, awake, put on thy ſtrength O Zion, put on thy beautiful gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments O Jeruſalem.</hi> The very truth of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is;</p>
               <p n="1">1. As the words are a promiſe (although after the manner of Gods ſpeaking by his Spirit in the Prophets, it is expreſſed in the preterperfect tenſe) and as the good promiſed is expreſſed by the name of <hi>Salvation</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> (theſe in effect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one thing) ſo by Righteouſneſs is meant Gods beneficence and bounty, with the ſeveral fruits of it confer'd upon his Church, in their preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:95157:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>deliverances, reſtorations—In this ſence the word [Righteouſneſs] is frequently taken in Scripture, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.12. <hi>It is time to ſeek the Lord, till he come and rain Righteouſneſs upon you.</hi> Pſ. 24.5. <hi>He ſhall receive Righteouſneſs from the God of his ſalvation;</hi> ſo that there is no more cauſe to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, That by Righteouſneſs in <hi>Eſa.</hi> 61.10. is meant Chriſts perſonal Righteouſneſs, than to make the ſame conſtruction of the word in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces fore-cited, where God promiſeth to rain Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs upon them, or that they ſhall receive Righteouſneſs from him, as the God of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for the Metaphorical expreſſion, of being clothed and covered with the garment of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and robe of righteouſneſs, it is an alluſion to the cuſtom of the Jews (and indeed of all Nations) which was to clothe and attire themſelves ſutably to their preſent condition, whether of proſperity, or adverſity, faſting or feaſting times, as is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>v.</hi> 3. of that Chapter in theſe words <hi>(To ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point to them, that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for aſhes, the garment of praiſe for the ſpirit of heavineſs)</hi> So that by the whole of that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, we can underſtand no more, than the great goodneſs and bounty of God (let the particulars in the retail thereof, whether in temporals or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals, or in both, be what they will) promiſed, or manifeſted to his Church, and manifeſted by them, in a ſuitable manner of open and ſolemn re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing for them.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>May it not be truly ſaid in ſome ſence, that Believers are clothed with Chriſts Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes: Yet more fully be it known, that as it may be truly and falſly ſaid, that Chriſts
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:95157:100"/>Righteouſneſs is imputed to us [according to the different ſences of the word Righteouſneſs, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the third Chapter] ſo it is both true and falſe to ſay, That we are clothed with the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt, <hi>e. g.</hi> Chriſts Righteouſneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken properly in its eſſential nature, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly falſe to ſay, that we are clothed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: For ſo taken, it is Chriſts own clothing, and not ours, he is glorious in this apparrel, and he will not give this his glory to another; and as <hi>Saul</hi>'s Armour would not fit <hi>David,</hi> ſo neither will Chriſts Righteouſneſs [taken in this ſence] ſuit with any other but himſelf, who was God and man in one perſon. As it is a point of diſloyalty in a vaſſal, to put on the Enſigns of Majeſty upon himſelf (The Crown Royal upon his head—) ſo it is a diſloyal thought, a moſt unbecoming thing, for a wretched ſinner to imagine himſelf veſted with the Royal Robe of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, the only begotten Son of God. But as the word Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is taken improperly, <hi>Effectivè,</hi> for the fruits and effects of it, ſo it is true to ſay, That we are clothed with his Righteouſneſs <hi>(i. e.)</hi> we are clothed, our ſpiritual nakedneſs is covered, we are arrayed with a garment, or garments, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or purchaſed with the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt. So that, if the Queſtion were thus form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>May Chriſts Righteouſneſs be truly ſaid to be a ſinners clothing?</hi> It muſt be anſwered, That this Propoſition [Chriſts Righteouſneſs is a ſinners clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing] is true <hi>Praedicatione cauſali,</hi> but not <hi>Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiali,</hi> or <hi>formali (i. e.)</hi> it <hi>it ſelf,</hi> or in it ſelf, is not our clothing, nor are we veſted in, or with it, but with the fruits of it, it being the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cauſe, that hath procured all neceſſary clothing for the covering of our nakedneſs, for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:95157:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>appearance before God, and our gracious acceptance with him; which clothing may ſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be refer'd (I think) to theſe two heads, <hi>viz.</hi> Juſtification and Sanctification, both which may be ſaid to be our clothing. Nevertheleſs I do judg it to be more fitly and intelligibly ſaid, That our ſins are covered with a pardon, rather than with Chriſts Righteouſneſs, the one being verified in an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſence, the other in a ſence more remote both in it ſelf, and from common underſtanding. But it muſt ever be remembred, that the pardon which covers our ſins, is a bleſſing purchaſed by the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt; and for that reaſon, in ſuch a ſence as a ranſomed Captive, or bought Servant, is ſaid to be his Maſters, or Redeemers money, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was bought with their money, in a like ſence may the clothing, wherewith we are clothed, be ſaid to be the Robe of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, becauſe Chriſts Righteouſneſs was the price, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with that our clothing (whatſoever it be, be it ſanctification or juſtification, grace or glory; for even with this Believers are ſaid to be clothed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2, 4.) was dearly bought or purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And in this ſence the price, or hire it ſelf, which is given for an Houſe, is uſed to ſignifie the Houſe, wherewith it was hired, as appears by <hi>Act.</hi> 28.30. where the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſignifie the hire of a thing (be it of an Houſe, or ought elſe) and which was given by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or ſome other in his behalf, is ſtyled, His own hired Houſe.</p>

               <p>Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s miſtake in thinking, That when all ſin is anſwered for, all the Righteouſneſs, which God requireth for that time, is not fulfilled; the contrary whereunto is proved. Several other of his miſtakes diſcovered, and his miſ-interpretations of ſeveral Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>FOraſmuch as there are ſeveral paſſages in Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s Book, of <hi>Communion with God,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the contrary is aſſerted, to what hath been maintained in the foregoing Chapters (he aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That over and above the taking away the guilt of ſin, it is neceſſary in order to our being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that we ſhould be actually righteous, and for that purpoſe, that the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt ſhould be imputed to us) I ſhall therefore think it not amiſs, to recite the chief of thoſe paſſages, and to reply thereunto, which ſhall be the ſubject of three or four of the enſuing Chapters.</p>
               <p>The Doctor having told us, That Chriſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies for ſin, and procures the remiſſion of it, <hi>p.</hi> 116. he proceeds to ſay in the following page;</p>

This is the ſouls ſecond enquiry, and it finds a reſolution on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Lord Chriſt: For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved by his life; his death reconciled us, then are we ſaved by his life. The actual obedience, which he yielded to the whole Law of God, is that Righteouſneſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are ſaved. If ſo be we are found in him, not having our own righteouſneſs, which is of the Law, but the Righteouſneſs, which is of God by faith,</hi> Phil. 3.9. <hi>This I ſhall have occaſion to handle more at large hereafter.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Somewhat to this purpoſe being alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by other Authors, hath been already anſwered in <hi>Chap.</hi> 23. Nevertheleſs I ſhall here make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, to every dictinct paſſage in the words re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When all ſin is anſwered for, all the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, which God requireth for that time, is fulfilled: For the Law is fulfill'd two ways, <hi>viz.</hi> Either by performance of perfect obedience to it, or by ſuffering ſufficient puniſhment for the breach of it. Either of theſe is a ſatisfaction to the juſtice of God. Now Gods Law doth not bind to both theſe <hi>Copulativè (i. e.)</hi> it binds not a perſon to both theſe at once, but <hi>Disjunctivè (i. e.)</hi> it binds him to obedience, or to puniſhment, primarily and abſolutely to the one, ſecondarily and <hi>Ex hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſi (i. e.)</hi> upon failure of that obedience, to the other. Neither was <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:95157:102"/>nor are we ſince bound to both at once; not we, I ſay, more than was <hi>Adam:</hi> For ſatisfaction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made for our crime, we ceaſe to be ſinners, and do become righteous in this ſence, that we are no longer bound to ſuffer, and we are entitled to a right of being dealt with as righteous: We are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed bound to obedience for the future, not to that obedience, for the not performing whereof, by puniſhment we have made ſatisfaction, but to another new obedience, which if we do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, then are we bound by the Law to new pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. So that Chriſt having obliged himſelf to make ſatisfaction, by ſuffering ſuch puniſhment as was equivalent to that, which by our ſins was deſerved, and our ſins being pardoned for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit-ſake thereof, we thereupon are dealt with as righteous; and for the future we are bound to new obedience, or to new puniſhment, not to both at once, no more than was <hi>Adam</hi> in innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. The Law requireth not of us both ſuffering and obedience, in reſpect of the ſame time, and actions.</p>
               <p>The conſideration of this makes it moſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that if ſin be pardoned, the Imputation of Chriſts active Righteouſneſs, or the Righteouſneſs of the life of Chriſt (as is the Doctor's expreſſion) is needleſs. And it is to no purpoſe to alledg, that the Law requires ſuffering for the time paſt, and obedience for the future, which hath been acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged: For Chriſt hath made ſatisfaction for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſins, and ere long thoſe future ſins will be paſt, and if we do not obey for the future, we ſin, and if we ſin, the Law requireth only our ſuffering for expiation, and foraſmuch as Chriſts expiatory ſuffering, or propitiation hath ſatisfied for that, the benefit whereof a ſinner doth enjoy in a renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:95157:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>pardon, he is no longer obliged to ſuffer. So that the contrary opinion, to what I here main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, doth in the conſequence thereof deny, that Chriſt hath ſatisfied for future ſins.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a palpable error in the Doctor to ſay, That by taking away the guilt of ſin, we are as perſons innocent, but ſomething more is required to make us to be conſidered as perſons obedient: For foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as ſin is as well of omiſſion, as of commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it follows unavoidably, that if the guilt of the former be taken away, as well as of the latter, it is impoſſible, but that a ſinner ſo pardoned ſhould be conſidered, and dealt with as obedient; for not to tranſgreſs the Law, and to fulfil the Law, are the ſame thing, as is eaſily proveable by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: For to tranſgreſs the Law, is to violate it by doing what it forbids, or by omitting what it commands; <hi>Ergo,</hi> Not to tranſgreſs the Law, is not to violate it, either by committing the one, or omitting the other; and what is this, but to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the Law? For he, that doth neither commit the evil forbidden by the Law, nor omit the good therein commanded, doth fulfil it.</p>
               <p>In ſhort I ſay, 1. That an innocent perſon ſhall doubtleſs go to heaven, and be rewarded, though he be no more than ſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I am not apt to think, that any rational creature can be more than innocent; for to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, is to be no tranſgreſſor of any Law <hi>(i.e.)</hi> of any Law which commands good, or forbids evil; and how any one can rationally be conceived to be more innocent, than to be no tranſgreſſor of any ſuch Law, I do not know, except there be works of ſupererrogation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is the Doctor's groſs miſtake to think, that <hi>Adam</hi>'s obedience to the divine command,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:95157:103"/>(Do this) was by God conſtiuted the condition of his having a right, or title to life (for that right he had already, by vertue of that habitual innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or holineſs, in which he was created) whereas it was the condition only of his holding that right to life, which at preſent he had. And if <hi>Adam</hi> could not have had a title to life, before he had kept all the Commandments, he could not have had right ſo long as he liv'd (I mean) not till his laſt gaſp.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Doctor very abſurdly ſuppoſeth things contradictory in ſuppoſing, That <hi>Adam</hi> was, or could be innocent any longer, than he did conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to keep Gods Commandments: For he, who doth only forbear the evil, which God forbids, but doth not do the good enjoyned, is neither tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor reputatively innocent.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is falſly ſaid by the Doctor, That the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the ſaid enquiry, is found in the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the life of Chriſt, which he lived up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, this being evidently his meaning, for which he quotes two Scriptures, but abuſes both of them.</p>
               <p>For 1. By that life of Chriſt, by which the Apoſtle ſays, we ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. is not meant the life of Chriſt, which in the ſtate of his humiliation he lived upon earth, but the life of glory, which he (never to die again) doth now live, in his eſtate of exaltation and ſeſſion at the right hand of God, of which his life the Apoſtle ſpeaks in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>He ever liveth to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As for that other Text alledged by him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. he hath often abuſed it, as often as in any place of his Book he hath handled it: For by the Righteouſneſs there ſaid to be of God by faith,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:95157:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>is not meant Chriſts perſonal Righteouſneſs (the Righteouſneſs of Chriſts life imputed to Believers) but that Righteouſneſs, which doth conſiſt in the faith of Chriſt, or in being faithful Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXII.</head>
               <p>That it is no where ſaid in Scripture, that we do receive the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. The Doctor's perverting that in <hi>Phil. 3.9.</hi> from the true meaning of the Apoſtle. That he perverts the ſence of <hi>1 Cor. 1.30.</hi> utterly beſide the meaning of the Apoſtle. That he miſtakes the ſence of <hi>Rom. 5.10.</hi> That Chriſt hath done no more by the obedience of his life for a ſinners ſalvation, than for his reconciliation, the contrary whereunto is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by Dr. <hi>O.</hi> His iterated miſtake touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the end of <hi>Adam</hi>'s obedience.</p>
               <p>THE Doctor ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 186. <hi>The Righteouſneſs we receive, is oppoſed to our own obedience to the Law; oppoſed to it, not as ſomething in another kind, but as ſomething in the ſame kind, excluding that from ſuch an end, which the other obtains. Now this is that obedience of Chriſt to the Law; himſelf thereby being made to us Righteouſneſs,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. By the Righteouſneſs we receive, it is evident, that the Doctor means Chriſts obedience
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:95157:104"/>to the Law, performed in his life-time; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I anſwer, That it is neither ſaid in that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, neither is there ſuch a ſaying in any other Scripture, That Believers do receive the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt, or his obedience to the Law; although it be true, that they do in a paſſive ſence of the word receive it <hi>(i. e.)</hi> they by means of their believing, do enjoy the righteouſneſs or obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Chriſt, in the ſaving fruits and effects thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Doctor doth err<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> groſly in thinking, That by the righteouſneſs of the Law, the Apoſtle means his own <hi>evangelical</hi> righteouſneſs, or obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Goſpel-Law, and that this is it, which heoppoſes to Chriſts perſonal righteouſneſs, or to Chriſts obedience to the Law: For it is plain both by the Text it ſelf, and Context, That by the Law he means the Jewiſh Law, and that by his own righteouſneſs, he means that which was his own, when a Jew (not that which was his own, when a Convert to the Chriſtian faith) and that the things there oppoſed are Judaiſm and Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or Judaical obſervances, and the practical knowledg of Chriſt. So that our own evangelical righteouſneſs, is neither in the ſame kind, nor in any other kind, there oppoſed to the obedience of Chriſt; nor is it either in that Scripture, or in any other, excluded from ſuch an end, which Chriſts Righteouſneſs doth obtain, I mean, the ſalvation of a ſinner: For in order to this end, our evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical righteouſneſs ſtands not in any oppoſition, but in a due ſubordination to Chriſts. As Chriſts Righteouſneſs doth, after a manner peculiar to it ſelf, ſo doth our own righteouſneſs, in its manner, tend to our obtaining that, which St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſtyles, <hi>The end of our faith, even the ſalvation of our ſouls.</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:95157:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>Whence that command of the Apoſtle, <hi>So run, that ye may obtain,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.24. It is by running, that (through, by, or under Chriſt) we do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Doctor perverts the ſence of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. that Scripture in no fort proving the thing, for the proof whereof it is alledged by him: For the Apoſtle doth not there ſay (as he would have him) That Chriſt is made Righteouſneſs unto us by Gods reckoning, or imputing Chriſts perfect and compleat obedience of the Law unto us, this being the thing undertaken by him to be proved by that Scripture; which as that Scripture doth not prove, (for it proves only, that Chriſt was of God made Righteouſneſs unto us) ſo another place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21.) doth moſt convincingly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it; it being there aſſerted, that we are made in Chriſt the Righteouſneſs of God <hi>(i. e.)</hi> very righteous by God (the abſtract being put for the concrete, as is very uſual in the language of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and particularly ſo uſed, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 60.17. where God promiſeth to his Church, that he will make all their Exactors Righteouſneſs <hi>(i. e.)</hi> very juſt, honeſt, or righteous) it being, I ſay, there aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that we are of God made in Chriſt moſt righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, by means of his being made ſin <hi>(i. e.)</hi> a ſin-offering for us, not by Gods reckoning to us Chriſts perfect and compleat obedience to the Law.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Page again he abuſes that Text in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. ſaying, <hi>The iſſue of the death of Chriſt is placed upon reconciliation, that is a ſlaying of the enmity, and reſtoring us into that condition of peace and friendſhip, wherein</hi> Adam <hi>was before his fall. But is there no more to be done? Notwithſtanding that there was no wrath due to</hi> Adam, <hi>yet be was to
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:95157:105"/>obey, if he would enjoy eternal life: Something moreover there is to be done in reſpect of us, if after the ſlaying of the enmity and reconciliation made, we ſhall enjoy life; being reconciled by his death, we are ſaved by that perfect obedience, which in his life he yielded to the Law of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I have already vindicated that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, from the ſame abuſe put upon it by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, having manifeſted, that by the life of Chriſt, is there meant the life which he now lives in glory, interceding for us at the right hand of God, not the life which he lived on earth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Had the Apoſtle meant the life, which Chriſt lived on earth, it will not thence follow, that his meaning was, that we are ſaved, by Gods reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us the perfect and compleat obedience of that his life <hi>(i. e.)</hi> imputing his obedience it ſelf unto us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though being reconciled to God, there is ſomewhat to be done by us <hi>(i. e.)</hi> in order to the continuing of our friendſhip with God—neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there needs no more to a ſinners ſalvation at preſent, than his preſent reconciliation, nor doth there need more to his future and final ſalvation, than the continuance of his reconciliation and friendſhip with God: For if being reconciled to God, he and we do continue friends, we ſhall as certainly be ſaved, as it is certain, that Chriſt at the right hand of God, ever liveth to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is ſalſly inſinuated by the Doctor, That Chriſt hath done more, or that it is needful, that he ſhould do more for our ſalvation, than for our reconciliation, I mean, for the beginning, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing, or perfecting of the one, than of the other, ſalvation from the guilt of ſin, whether it be ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:95157:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>progreſſive, or conſummate, being in effect the ſame benefit with Reconciliation with God, in its being begun, continued, and made perfect in the fruit thereof.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If there was no wrath due to <hi>Adam,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could ever have obſtructed his entrance into life, the contrary whereunto is preſumed by the Doctor.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As it was once already ſaid, ſo I ſay again, That <hi>Adam</hi> was to obey, not that he might enjoy a right to eternal life, which he had not antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to that his actual obedience, but that his ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thereunto might be continued, and he thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might be brought at laſt to the full enjoyment thereof.</p>
               <p>The Doctor proceeds in the ſame Page, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe the Scriptures by whole cluſters, which I will endeavour to manifeſt in the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

               <p>The Doctor's allegation of ſeveral Scriptures, to no purpoſe.

               <p>HE ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 186. <hi>There is diſtinct mention made of Reconciliation, through a non-imputation of ſin, as</hi> Pſal. 32.1. Luk. 1.77. Rom. 3.25. 2 Cor. 5.19. <hi>and juſtification, through an Imputation of righteouſneſs,</hi> Jer. 23.6. Rom. 4.5. 1 Cor. 1.30. <hi>although theſe things are ſo far from being ſeparated, that they are reciprocally affirmed of one another, which as it doth not evince an identity, ſo it doth an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent conjunction. And this laſt we have by the life of Chriſt.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. There is no mention at all ſo much as of the word Reconciliation, in three of the four recited Scriptures, <hi>viz.</hi> Pſal. 32.1. Luk. 1.77. Rom. 3.25.
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:95157:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>And by peruſing the places the Reader may know, whether he ſhould believe the Doctor, or his own eyes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Much leſs is there mention of Reconciliation, through a non-imputation of ſin, as diſtinct from juſtification, in any of thoſe three Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though there be mention of Reconciliation, and a non-imputation of ſin, in one of the fore-ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Scriptures, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. yet neither is the one, or the other there mentioned, as diſtinct from ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, through an Imputation of Chriſts Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, as the Doctor ſays.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We are no otherwiſe juſtified, than we are pardoned, or reconciled to God, through the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs it ſelf being no more neceſſary, nor acting any otherwiſe for the effecting of the one, than of the other, the agency thereof being that of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally efficient, or meritorious cauſe, towards our remiſſion, reconciliation, and juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If by the Doctor's confeſſion, reconciliation and juſtification are reciprocally affirmed one of another, I am apt to think, that Philoſophy will warrant us from thence to conclude an identity. And by the laſt fore-cited Scripture, the identity, which the Doctor denies, may undoubtedly be evinced: For the non-imputation of ſin, together with our reconciliation with God, is there menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned as all one, even the ſelf ſame thing, with our being made the Righteouſneſs of God in Chriſt, which may be truly paraphraſed, with our being juſtified by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; but is falſly gloſſed, as the Doctor would have it, with the Imputation of the perfect and compleat righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:95157:107"/>or obedience of Chriſt to the Law of God.</p>
               <p>As for the other three places of Scripture al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by him, he doth manifeſtly wreſt them: For</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Though it be ſaid in <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.6.

                  <item>2. Although in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. there is mention made of Gods Imputing Righteouſneſs unto us, yet by Righteouſneſs is not there meant the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt <hi>(i. e.)</hi> his perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat obedience to the Law, nor are we by that expreſſion of the Apoſtle given to underſtand, that the ſaid righteouſneſs, or obedience of Chriſt is imputed to us, but by it is meant a certain righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, which is the effect and fruit of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, and which for the ſake of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, is imputed to us, or confer'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</item>

               <p>P. 187. <hi>THIS (that is, the diſtinct mention of Reconciliation, through a non-imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſin, and Juſtification, through an Imputation of righteouſneſs) is fully expreſſed, in that Typical repreſentation of our juſtification before the Lord,</hi> Zech. 3.3, 4, 5. <hi>Two things are there expreſſed, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to our free Acceptation before God,</hi> 1. <hi>The taking away the guilt of our ſin, our filthy robes: This is done by the death of Chriſt, remiſſion of ſin is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per fruit thereof; but there is more alſo required, even a Collation of righteouſneſs, and thereby a right to life eternal; this is here called fine change of ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: So the Holy Ghoſt expreſſeth it again,</hi> Eſa. 61.10. <hi>where he calls it plainly the garment of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and the robe of righteouſneſs: Now this is only made ours by the obedience of Chriſt, as the other by his death.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are now come to Viſions and Revelations of the Lord, in the Expoſitions whereof, I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:95157:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>my ſelf to have little exerciſed my talent; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs I reply;</p>
               <p n="1">1. In a flat gainſaying his interpretation, and denial, that this <hi>(i. e.)</hi> that reconciliation with God, and juſtification, through the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, as things diſtinct, is fully expreſſed, in that Typical repreſentation of the matter in <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. For although I do yield, that remiſſion of ſins is repreſented by that viſible ſign, (<hi>I have cauſed thine iniquities (i. e.)</hi> in the guilt and puniſhment of them, <hi>to paſs from thee (i. e.)</hi> I have pardoned them) nevertheleſs I deny, that by the fine change of rayment, is there meant the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, or juſtification, through the Imputation of it unto us; but I rather think, that by it is meant our own perſonal righteouſneſs, or holineſs, which doth oft-times in Scripture, go under the Metaphorical expreſſion of a ſplendid veſt, fine linnen, robe, or the like, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready manifeſted.</p>
               <p>Briefly, My opinion is, That in the ſaid viſion of the Prophet, there is a repreſentation of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation (or remiſſion of ſin) and ſanctification, as diſtinct things, but not (as the Doctor will have it expounded) of reconciliation (or remiſſion) and of juſtification, through the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Remiſſion of ſin is no more the proper fruit of Chriſts death (as the Doctor ſays) than is our juſtification; for as the Apoſtle ſomewhere ſays, <hi>(We have redemption through his Blood, even the Forgiveneſs of our ſins)</hi> ſo he doth elſewhere ſay, <hi>We are juſtified by his Blood,</hi> Rom. 5.9. I doubt not to ſay, It is a great miſtake in this Doctor (as in many others) to aſſign our Reconciliation, or remiſſion of ſin, and our Juſtification, to ſeveral
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:95157:109"/>diſtinct cauſes, the former to Chriſts paſſive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience (his death) the other to his active (the obedience of his life imputed) whereas the truth is in theſe two things;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That reconciliation, or remiſſion of ſin, and juſtification, are the ſelf ſame thing in effect, as was aforeſaid.</item>
                  <item>2. Being the ſame thing in effect, although they are expreſſed by divers names, yet they are wholly to be aſcribed to the whole obedience of Chriſt (both of his life and death) as joyntly conſtituting the meritorious cauſe thereof; ſo that neither is remiſſion of ſin, to be more ſaid to be the proper fruit of Chriſts death, than juſtification, nor juſtification, more properly the fruit of Chriſts life, than remiſſion of ſin.</item>
                  <item>3. I deny what the Doctor here affirms, <hi>viz.</hi> That over and above remiſſion of ſin, there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a collation of righteouſneſs, in order to a right to heaven. This hath been at large already diſproved in <hi>Ch.</hi> 23.</item>
                  <item>4. Whether the Doctor doth here aſſert Chriſts Righteouſneſs it ſelf, or a right to eternal life thereby confer'd, to be the fine linnen ſpoken of in <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. is queſtionable: For it is doubtful, what conſtruction he would have his Readers to make of the Relative <hi>This,</hi> (he ſaying, This is here called fine change of rayment) I mean, whether he would have it underſtood concerning the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt, or concerning the right to life eternal by it. This latter conſtruction is of the two more obvious and rational, becauſe right to eternal life, is in the order of his words the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Antecedent, the other (a collation of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs) being a little more remote. But let him be underſtood of either, as I ſaid before, ſo I ſay
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:95157:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>again, That by the fine change of rayment, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe are to be underſtood, but the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of ſanctification, or fine veſtment of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</item>
                  <item>5. In the Expoſition of <hi>Eſay</hi> 61.10. I perceive a great difference betwixt the Doctor, and very many of the Brethren of his mind in this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie: For they undertaking to ſhew the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Ghoſt therein, do confidently ſay, That the Holy Ghoſt, by the robe of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and garment of ſalvation there mentioned, doth mean, The Righteouſneſs of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and thence it is, that they do rhetorically ſet forth the properties thereof, under the notion of a Veſt, how that it is Fine, Pure, White, Rich, Splendid—But the Doctor tells us, That the Holy Ghoſt ſays not ſo; for that, which the Holy Ghoſt doth there mean by the garment of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is not the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, but a right to eternal life collated upon us, by the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt imputed to us. Upon this occaſion, I call to mind what is charged upon the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of old, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.7. <hi>They ſaid, the Lord ſaith it, albeit the Lord never ſpoke it.</hi> In like ſort may it be ſaid, concerning the Authors of both the ſaid Interpretations, They ſay, The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt means this and that by the garment of ſalvation, and the Robe of Righteouſneſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the truth is, the Holy Ghoſt in the Prophets words, did mean neither this, nor that, but ſome other thing (as I have already demonſtrated in <hi>Chap.</hi> 30.)</item>
                  <item>6. Whereas the Doctor concludes, ſaying (This is only made ours by the obedience of Chriſt) and whereas his meaning therein is, that the other, <hi>viz.</hi> Remiſſion of ſin, or reconciliation, is made
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:95157:110"/>ours by the death of Chriſt, I ſhall ſtill deny it <hi>Toties Quoties,</hi> even as oft as the Doctor ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The Doctor proceeds to anſwer an Objection, which in his ſagacity, he fore-ſaw would be made againſt the doctrine by him maintained, touching the Imputation of Chriſts perfect obedience to the Law (even it it ſelf) unto us, <hi>viz.</hi> That it will follow from thence, that we are as righteous as is Chriſt himſelf. But this Objection, together with the Doctor's unſatisfactory Anſwer thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, I have already mentioned, and made a reply to upon a fit occaſion, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 25. to which I ſhall refer the Reader.</p>

                  <hi>That our deliverance from a ſtate of rejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or un-acceptation, and our Acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, are not two things, and to be aſcribed to two ſeveral cauſes, as the Doctor pretends.

               </p>
               <p>P. 193. <hi>BY his death Chriſt bearing the curſe, undergoing the puniſhment, that was
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:95157:111"/>due to us, paying the ranſom, that was due for us, delivers us from this condition (that is, a ſtate of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and our un-acceptation) and thus far the death of Chriſt is the cauſe of our Acceptation with God, that all cauſe of quarrel and rejection of us is thereby taken away; and to that end are his ſufferings reckoned to us: For being made ſin for us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. <hi>he is made righteouſneſs unto us,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Doctor doth moſt unreaſonably make a ſinners deliverance, from a ſtate of rejection or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptation, and his Acceptation with God, to be two things, whereas they are indeed but one and the ſame thing, and done at the ſame time, by one and the ſame divine act: For as the Phyſician doth not remove the diſeaſe by one act, and reſtore health to the Patient by another act (healing the diſeaſe, and reſtoring health, being but two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent names, or conſiderations of one and the ſame thing) in like manner God doth not deliver from a ſtate of un-acceptation by one act, and reſtore us to a ſtate of Acceptation by another, theſe two being but two different names, expreſſions, noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or conſiderations of the ſame thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As our deliverance from a ſtate of un-accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and our Acceptation with God, are the ſelf ſame thing, and done by one and the ſame act of God, ſo they are to be aſcribed to the ſelf ſame cauſe, and not unto different cauſes, as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor would have them to be aſſigned, to wit, the former preciſely to the death of Chriſt, or the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Chriſts ſufferings to us, the latter to the life of Chriſt, or Imputation of the obedience of his life to us, neither of which indeed (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:95157:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>his doings, or ſufferings) are properly, and in themſelves reckoned to us, but only is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects thereof, as hath oft upon occaſion been before ſaid.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The whole of our reconciliation to God, (our deliverance from enmity, and reſtoration in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to divine favour, or friendſhip, if any one liſt to divide it into thoſe two parts) our Acceptation with God, or Juſtification before God, is aſcribed to the death of Chriſt, as hath been already prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. the ſame being alſo proveable from <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As one of thoſe Scriptures alledged by the Doctor (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30.) makes nothing for him, ſo the other (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21.) makes point blank, and moſt fully againſt him, as hath been already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated.</p>
               <p>The Doctor goes on, ſaying, in the ſame Page, and in the words immediately follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But yet farther, This (that is, the removal of our guilt, or deliverance from a ſtate of rejection, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptation) will not compleat our Acceptation with God. The old quarrel may be laid aſide, and yet no new friendſhip begun. We may be not ſinners, and yet not be ſo far righteous, as to have a right to the kingdom of heaven.</hi> Adam <hi>had no right to life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was innocent, he muſt moreover do This, and then he ſhall live. He muſt not only have a negative righteouſneſs, he was not guilty of any thing, but alſo a poſitive righteouſneſs, he muſt do all things. This then is required in the ſecond place, to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Acceptation, that we have not only the non-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of ſin, but alſo a reckoning of righteouſneſs. Now this we have in the obedience of the life of Chriſt. This alſo was diſcovered in the laſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:95157:112"/>The obedience of the life of Chriſt was for us, is imputed to us, and is our Righteouſneſs before God: By his obedience are we made righteous,</hi> Rom. 5.18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this in effect hath been already anſwered, the repetition whereof being needleſs, I add, that,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is here contrary to ſenſe and reaſon, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Doctor, that the old quarrel betwixt God and us may be taken away, and yet no new friendſhip begun: For it is alike as to ſuppoſe darkneſs to be expel'd, and yet no new light to be introduced, or ſickneſs removed, and no health brought in place. And as for the word (Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation) I have always hitherunto underſtood the meaning of the word (paſſively taken) that it is To be made friends; and I cannot reconcile it to ſenſe or reaſon, to make any other conſtruction of it, as if perſons could be Reconciled, and yet not made Friends.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a ſenſeleſs contradiction for the Doctor to imagine (as he doth) that <hi>Adam</hi> was not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of any thing, and yet that he had not a poſitive as well as a negative righteouſneſs: For to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, or ſuppoſe this, is to ſuppoſe him to be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of no ſin at all, and yet to ſuppoſe him guilty of ſome ſin <hi>(i. e.)</hi> of ſin, or ſins of omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Suppoſe that <hi>Adam</hi> muſt have a poſitive as well as a negative righteouſneſs, in order to his right to life, yet it will not follow from thence, That in order to our right to life, we muſt have the poſitive righteouſneſs, or perfect obedience of Chriſts life, in it ſelf imputed to us for that end,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:95157:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Imputation of Chriſts poſitive Righteouſneſs unto us for that purpoſe, being no more neceſſary, than the Imputation of his negative Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A non-imputation of ſin, and a reckoning of righteouſneſs, are the ſelf ſame thing in effect, as appears evidently by <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5, 6. and ſo likewiſe is reconciliation, or a non-imputation of ſin, all one with righteouſneſs, or our being made the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God in Chriſt, as appears by 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, 21. That act of God, whereby he doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly pardon our ſin, is interpretatively nothing elſe, but an Imputation of a perfect righteouſneſs, or a fulfilling of the Law, even as that act, by which the Sun diſpels the darkneſs, doth fill the air with light.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The obedience of Chriſt verily was for us, but it may not therefore be truly ſaid in it ſelf to be imputed to us, nor is it our righteouſneſs before God otherwiſe, than in a cauſal ſence.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Nor doth that Text here alledged by the Doctor (<hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18.) prove in the leaſt, that the obedience of Chriſts life is imputed to us, it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been oft times for this purpoſe alledged by him, but ſtill I muſt ſay, to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Imputation of righteouſneſs (which is indeed all one with the non-imputation of ſin) we have from the joynt obedience of Chriſts life and death, but not from both of them, or from either of them, in themſelves imputed to us.</p>

               <p>The difference betwixt Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> in their opinion, concerning the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, or Obedience unto us, plainly laid open in their own words, recited. That the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor denies Chriſts death to have been in our ſtead, but only as it was penal. The Author's opinion plainly and expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, in oppoſition to the Doctor's.

               </p>
               <p>I Shall cloſe what I have to ſay, concerning the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs unto us, by acquainting the Reader, that the fore-named Authors (Dr. <hi>O.</hi> and Mr. <hi>F.</hi>) do to my ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo plainly differ betwixt themſelves, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, by them aſſerted to be imputed to us, that I am not able to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them, Mr. <hi>F.</hi> aſſerting the Imputation of all Chriſts Mediatory Obedience unto us, but the Doctor only one part thereof: And that what ſeems thus to me, may appear to others, I will more at large recite the words of them both, and thereupon leave the judgment thereof, to every indifferent and intelligent Reader.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God</hi> (ſays Mr. <hi>F.</hi> p. 558, 559.) <hi>having admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the interpoſure of Chriſt on our behalf, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving inflicted ſufferings upon him, as a puniſhment
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:95157:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>for our ſins, and having accepted thoſe ſufferings, as a ſacrifice of atonement for the expiation of our guilt, and having alſo agreed with his Son, and declared in the Covenant of grace the terms, on which we are made partakers of the benefits thereof, we upon the performance of theſe conditions, come to have all that Chriſt did and ſuffered as our Mediator, Imputed to us in a Law-ſence. And this being all, that we do intend by a Legal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt, namely, That by the Covenant of redemption, Chriſt ſo becomes our Surrogate, as to have our ſins in a Law-ſence impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, and we through fulfilling the terms of the Covenant of grace, have all that Chriſt did and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered as our Mediator, Imputed in a Law-ſence to us: He muſt not only diſclaim Chriſts being Mediator in any proper ſence, but renounce the whole Goſpel, that donies it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we perceive plainly, that Mr. <hi>F.</hi> is for the Imputation of all Chriſts Mediatory obedience unto us (as of our ſins to him) in a Law-ſence, that is, and as that phraſe is uſually explained, in ſuch ſort, as if we had done all that he did, and ſuffered all that he ſuffered, or as if God did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, that we in and by Chriſt had done and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the whole thereof: Thus Mr. <hi>Rols</hi> in his <hi>Prodromus</hi> explains the ſence, ſaying (<hi>p.</hi> 86.) <hi>God reckons Believers in and by Chriſt their Surety, to have ſatisfied divine juſtice.</hi> And we perceive alſo by the words fore-cited, what a dreadful ſentence Mr. <hi>F.</hi> paſſes upon all thoſe, who gainſay the ſaid Imputation of all Chriſts Mediatory obedience; which (for ought I can perceive) will light hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily upon Dr. <hi>O.</hi> himſelf, as well as any others: For the Doctor doth diſtinguiſh concerning a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Law, to which Chriſt as our Mediator did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form obedience;</p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:95157:114"/>
               <p n="1">1. General <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the Law of nature, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law, comprizing every Law of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we were ſubject and obnoxious.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Special, or the peculiar Law of Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which reſpected himſelf meerly; and to this peculiar Law he refers Chriſts obedience in dying, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18. Thus he doth diſtinguiſh in his Book, (<hi>Comm.</hi> p. 178, 179.) Now what obedience of Chriſt is imputed to us, or to which of thoſe Laws [to one, or both] as he doth there deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, ſo he doth fully explain in his late Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>p.</hi> 213, 214. whoſe words I ſhall tranſcribe, as followeth;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plainly</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I have ſhewed, that there was an eſpecial Law of Mediatorſhip, which Chriſt was ſubject unto, as the commandment of the Father, That he ſhould be incarnate, that he ſhould be the King, Prieſt and Prophet of his Church, that he ſhould bear our iniquities, make his ſoul an offering for ſin, and give his life a ranſom for many, were the principal parts of this Law. The whole of it I have lately explain'd, in my Exercitations unto the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of the Expoſition, on the Epiſtle to the</hi> Hebrews. <hi>This Law our Lord Jeſus Chriſt did not yield obedience to in our ſtead, as if we had been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged originally unto the duties of it, which we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were, nor could be; although what he ſuffered penally in any of them, was in our ſtead, without which conſideration he could not have righteouſly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in any kind. And the following trivial ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of this Author, about the obligation on us to lay down our lives for the Brethren, is meet for him to put in; ſeeing we are not obliged ſo to die for any one, as Chriſt died for us. Was</hi> Paul <hi>crucified for you?</hi>

               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:95157:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ſecondly, Chriſt our Mediator, and as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, was obliged unto all that obedience unto the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law, and all other Laws of God, that the Church was obliged unto; and that, which I have aſſerted hereon is, That the effects of the former obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Chriſt are communicated unto us, but the latter obedience it ſelf is imputed unto us.</hi> And as for the former obedience, his expreſs words are, (<hi>Comm.</hi> p. 181.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is not Imputed unto us, as though we had done it, though the</hi>

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>and fruits of it are.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus by comparing the words of the ſaid Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors together, we may palpably perceive the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt them, reconcile them, who can for me; for I cannot; ſo that, how the Doctor can avoid coming under the ſaid terrible cenſure, or ſentence of his Brother Mr. <hi>F.</hi> I know not. But the comfort truly is, That as the curſe cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſhall not come, and is not therefore to be dreaded, ſo Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi>'s ſentence being ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, need not therefore to be feared, whether by the Doctor, or by any other: For he, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the Imputation of our ſin to Chriſt, and of all he did and ſuffered (all his active, and all his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive obedience) to us, in Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi>'s Law-ſence, doth not diſclaim Chriſt his being our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, in any proper ſence, nor doth he renounce any part, or tittle of the Goſpel, as hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready manifeſted in this Treatiſe; nor doth the ſaid denial impeach any ſuch Union of Believers with Chriſt, which the Scriptures do aſſert, by what name ſoever it be entitled, whether Legal, or Moral, or any other name of mans impoſing: Nor doth it properly belong to the office of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:95157:115"/>or to a proper Mediator, that what is done by him in perſon, ſhould be in it ſelf (properly and formally conſidered) imputed unto, or rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned as done by the perſon, in whoſe behalf he doth mediate. Yet if inſtead of the word Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, Mr. <hi>F.</hi> had uſed the word Surety, I would have yielded, That Chriſt is not in any place of Scripture ſaid to be our Surety, in a ſtrict and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſence of the word: For ſo far as hitherto I have apprehended the ſence of the word, in the propriety thereof, a proper Surety is bound to the Creditor in the ſelf ſame Bond or obligation, with the principal Debtor: Now the caſe betwixt Chriſt and us is otherwiſe; for he is not bound in the ſame Bond with us, nor was our obligation tranſlated upon him, or aſſumed by him, but he took upon him an obligation peculiar to himſelf, which obligation was not only individually, but alſo ſpecifically different from ours, ours being <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatio Criminis,</hi> and his only <hi>Contractus,</hi> as hath been before ſaid, and prov'd. Moreover, Chriſt is not our Surety in any more proper ſence, than our ſins are proper debts, or God a proper Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, which expreſſions are not proper, but Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical. And withal I will ſay, That although I ſhould deny, that Chriſt is in any place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaid to be our Surety in a proper ſence, yet it will not from thence follow, that I do deny the whole Goſpel, or any the leaſt ſcruple of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now return to the words of Dr. <hi>O.</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, whereupon I deſire it may be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That having aſſerted Chriſts dying for our ſins, to be a principal part of the Law of Mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:95157:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>peculiar to himſelf, he doth both affirm and deny his obedience thereunto to have been in our ſtead.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. He doth ſimply deny, that his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thereunto, or dying for us, was in our ſtead.</item>
                  <item>2. He doth affirm it in ſome reſpect to have been in our ſtead, <hi>viz.</hi> as his death was penal, and ſo likewiſe that all which he ſuffered penally, in what pertained to the peculiar Law of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, was in our ſtead; and this he affirms for this reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe otherwiſe he could not have righteouſly ſuffered in any kind.</item>
               </list>
               <p>To which I reply;</p>
               <p n="1">1. To the reaſon of his affirmation, and that by denying the force of it, and by aſſerting the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>viz.</hi> That although Chriſts death as penal, had not been in our ſtead <hi>(i. e.)</hi> imputed to us, in the Law-ſence as aforeſaid, as if we had ſuffered in and by him what he ſuffered (which is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's meaning of the word <hi>[inſtead]</hi> neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he might righteouſly ſuffer, and he did righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſuffer in that kind, and in many other kinds beſides death it ſelf: For he did no leſs ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, than at the will of his Father, take upon him an obligation ſo to do <hi>(i. e.)</hi> to be obedient, even unto death, for the expiation of our ſins; whereupon the Doctor may remember the old and true ſaying, <hi>Volenti non fit injuria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As to what was both affirmed and denied by the Doctor, I reply;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. What he denies ſimply, I ſhall ſimply affirm, That Chriſts death was in our ſtead, yea in all manner of conſiderations of it, it was in our ſtead.</item>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:95157:116"/>
                  <item>2. What he affirms concerning the death of Chriſt in one reſpect, or under one conſideration of his death, I ſhall deny under conſideration of the ſence of the phraſe [inſtead] as by him intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſaying, Chriſt did not either in that, or any other conſideration of his death, die in our ſtead, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> ſtrictly, and in a Law-ſence, <hi>In perſonâ no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrâ,</hi> as if ſo be God had reckoned his death to be our death, or that we had ſuffered death in and by him, or as if our obligation to ſuffer puniſhment, had been transfer'd upon him.</item>
                  <item>3. Foraſmuch as the Doctor doth ſimply deny, that, which for my own part I never did, but do ſimply and poſitively affirm the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That the death of Chriſt was in our <hi>ſtead,</hi> I may well think it ſtrange, that he hath hitherto eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the charge of Socinianiſm; whereas if my ſelf, or any of my Brethren, who maintain what I have profeſſedly aſſerted in this controverſie, ſhould ſimply deny, That Chriſts death was in our ſtead, I am much afraid, that we ſhould not ſo eſcape, but that rather our names would be enrolled in that black Liſt. But that it may farther appear, what a great gulf there is fixed betwixt us and the Socinians, I do here profeſs in my own (and I do not know, but that I may ſincerely make the ſame profeſſion, in the name of all thoſe my Brethren) ſaying,</item>
               </list>
               <p>After all this Diſpute, I do freely and plainly confeſs and acknowledg, and this I do without any of Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s diſtinctions, That All Chriſts Mediatory Obedience, To Any Law Whatſoever, [Common To Us, Or Peculiar To Himſelf] Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially His Obedience To The Death Of The Croſs, Was Under All Conſiderations [Both As A Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:95157:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>As A Price, And As A Sacrifice] In Our Stead; And Foraſmuch As The Dignity, Or Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue Of All His Obedience, Did Depend Upon The Dignity Of His Perſon (He Being Both God, And Man) I Do Confeſs, That All His Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence Was In Our Stead (That is) To Beſtead Us, And That It Did Beſtead Us, In The Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing Of A Pardon, And Life Eternal For Us, Upon Terms Expreſſed In the Goſpel, Promiſed To Us, And Upon Performance Thereof, To Be Confer'd Upon Us; And That the Said Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence Of Chriſt (Both Active, and Paſſive, As It Is Uſually Stiled) Is Imputed To Us, Although Not Immediately, And In It Self, Yet To As Much Purpoſe, And Real Benefit, As If It Were Actually, Or Could Poſſibly Be So Imputed, (that is) That It Is Imputed To Us In All Its Saving Fruits, And Bleſſed Effects, All That His Foreſaid Obedience, Making Up One Entire Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious Cauſe Of All The Said Benefits, And Bleſſings.</p>
               <p>Hereupon as God makes his appeal, ſaying, <hi>(And now O Inhabitants of Jeruſalem, and men of Judah, judge I pray you between me and my vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, what could have been done more, than—)</hi> in like ſort ſhall I make my appeal to all, ſaying, And now (Men, Brethren and Fathers) judge I pray you betwixt us, who do make the ſaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of our faith in this matter, and our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, who notwithſtanding will clamour againſt us, and ſtigmatize us with that odious name of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinianiſm; what need we? what can we <hi>[ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:95157:117"/>
               <p>Laſtly, I reply upon occaſion of the Doctor's fore-cited words, That foraſmuch as he doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg Chriſts death to have been in our ſtead, only as it was penal, or a puniſhment, it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore juſtly enquirable, under what conſideration, or in what reſpect his death was not in our ſtead; and by obſerving what he ſays concerning the death of Chriſt (<hi>p.</hi> 188. <hi>Comm.</hi>) it ſeems to me, That he denies it to be in our ſtead, as it was a Price, and as it was a Sacrifice; and that this may appear to others as well as to my ſelf, I will recite his words, as followeth;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The death of Chriſt is in Scripture propoſed under a three-fold conſideration, Of a Price, of a Sacrifice, and of a Penalty.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>It is a Price,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.20. 1 Pet. 1.19. 1 Tim. 4.6. <hi>Now the proper effect and iſſue of the death of Chriſt as a price, or ranſom, is Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. P. 189. <hi>It was a Sacrifice alſo,</hi> Heb. 10.5. Eſa. 53.10. Eph. 5.2. <hi>Now the end of Sacrifices, ſuch as his was, bloody, and for ſin,</hi> Rom. 4.3. Heb. 2.17. <hi>was Atonement and Reconciliation,</hi> Eph. 5.2. Eſa. 53.10. Dan. 9.24. Rom. 5.10.—</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>It was alſo a Puniſhment, a puniſhment in our ſtead,</hi> Eſa. 53.5.6.12. 1 Pet. 2.34.—<hi>Now bearing of puniſhment tends directly, to the giving ſatisfaction to him, who was offended, and on that account in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted the puniſhment—His ſubſtituting himſelf in our room, being allowed of by the Righteous Judg, ſatisfaction to him doth thence properly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>To this I reply, ſaying,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Redemption and Reconciliation are not at all diſtinct benefits of the death of Chriſt; for they
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:95157:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>are one and the ſelf ſame ſaving benefit, they being but diſtinct or ſeveral names, given in ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to one and the ſame thing: And the very truth is, That Redemption <hi>(i. e.)</hi> redemption from the guilt of ſin (I mean the word Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on paſſively taken) and Reconciliation with God, even as alſo forgiveneſs of ſin, and juſtification, with many other words which might be named, are Synonimous expreſſions in Scripture, import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in effect the ſelf ſame thing, as may appear by the current of the Scriptures, many whereof have been already named, to which, more, were it needful, may eaſily be added, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9, 10. and 4.24, 25. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13, 14. with <hi>v.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As Redemption and Reconciliation are one and the ſame ſaving benefit of Chriſts death, ſo much leſs do they flow from any ſuch nice, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct conſideration, as the Doctor affirms <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the one from the conſideration of Chriſts death, as a Price, and the other as a Sacrifice: But as they are in effect one ſaving benefit, ſo they flow from one cauſe, the death of Chriſt, our reconciliation flowing no more, or otherwiſe from the death of Chriſt as a Sacrifice, than as a Price; nor doth our redemption more flow from the death of Chriſt as a Price (however it may be thence denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) than from it as a Sacrifice, but entirely from the death of Chriſt, as a meritorious cauſe, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all one in effect to ſay, it follows from it as an expiatory Sacrifice, as to ſay, it follows from it as a valuable Price.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I know no more reaſon to ſay, That ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is the iſſue of Chriſts death, conſidered as a Penalty, than as it was a Price, or Sacrifice;
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:95157:118"/>for Chriſts death was as well a Price ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and a Sacrifice ſatisfactory, as a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſatisfactory: For the end of paying a Price, and the end of Sacrifices, was ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of its kind, and to ſay, that Chriſts death was a Propitiatory, or Expiatory Sacrifice, is all one (I ever thought) as to ſay, it is a Satisfactory Sacrifice. So that I am altogether diſſatisfied, as to the fountain, or riſe of the Satisfaction here mentioned by the Doctor, God being as well ſatisfied by the death of Chriſt, under the notion of a Price, or Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as of a Penalty.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In what ſence the death of Chriſt was, or may be ſaid to be a Puniſhment, I have already declared in anſwer to Mr. <hi>F.</hi> and it will not be needful here, to repeat what hath been there ſaid.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Finally, Whereas the Doctor doth only affirm, That Chriſts death was in our ſtead, under the conſideration of a Penalty, I have already in the third Branch of my Reply, ſhewed, That it was under all conſiderations in our ſtead (both as a Penalty, as a Price, and as a Sacrifice) and I have explained more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, in what ſence it was in our ſtead; and I deſire the Reader, that he would again ſo peruſe it, as if it had been in this place [to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with my ſaid Appeal] again inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:95157:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>I will conclude with that Prayer of <hi>Calvin,</hi> which <hi>Beza</hi> his Scholar tells us was his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant form, before his Lectures in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Schools; <hi>Det nobis Dominus in Coeleſtis ſuae ſapientiae myſteriis cum verae pietatis profru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctu verſari, in gloriam ſuam, &amp; aedificationem noſtram.</hi> Amen.</p>
